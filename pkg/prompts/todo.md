# Prompts Package Status - COMPLETED ✅

## Implementation Status
All required features have been successfully implemented according to the Beluga AI Framework principles.

### ✅ Completed Features

**Configuration Management:**
- ✅ `config.go` - Comprehensive configuration with functional options
- ✅ Environment variable support via mapstructure tags
- ✅ Validation using struct tags and custom validators

**Factory Pattern & Architecture:**
- ✅ `PromptManager` factory with dependency injection
- ✅ Factory methods for templates and adapters
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns following ISP, DIP, SRP

**Template Engine:**
- ✅ String template support using Go's text/template
- ✅ Variable extraction and validation
- ✅ Template caching with configurable TTL
- ✅ Multiple adapter types (Default, Chat)

**Schema Integration:**
- ✅ Integration with `pkg/schema` for standardized message formats
- ✅ Support for chat messages and string prompts
- ✅ Proper message type handling

**Observability:**
- ✅ OpenTelemetry metrics collection (`metrics.go`)
- ✅ Distributed tracing integration
- ✅ Structured logging with context
- ✅ Performance monitoring and health checks

**Error Handling:**
- ✅ Custom error types with proper error wrapping
- ✅ Error codes for programmatic handling
- ✅ Context-aware error information
- ✅ Validation errors with detailed context

**Testing:**
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite with table-driven tests
- ✅ Mock implementations for dependency testing
- ✅ Benchmark tests for performance validation
- ✅ Coverage of all major components and error cases

**Documentation:**
- ✅ Extensive README.md with usage examples
- ✅ Package-level documentation
- ✅ Interface documentation with examples
- ✅ API reference and best practices

## Architecture Principles Followed
- ✅ **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Small, focused interfaces
- ✅ **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: Dependencies injected via constructors
- ✅ **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each component has clear purpose
- ✅ **Composition over Inheritance**: Embedded interfaces for extensibility

## Current State
The prompts package is production-ready and fully compliant with Beluga AI Framework standards. All tests pass and the package provides:

- **Production Ready**: Complete implementation with all features
- **Extensible Framework**: Interfaces ready for custom implementations
- **Observable**: Full OTEL integration for monitoring
- **Well Tested**: Comprehensive test coverage
- **Well Documented**: Extensive documentation and examples

## Maintenance Notes
- Regular updates to dependencies as needed
- Monitor performance benchmarks
- Consider adding new template engines (Jinja2, Handlebars) as future enhancements
- Expand adapter types for additional LLM providers
