# Schema Package Redesign TODO

Schema is central for data formats; needs expansion.
Package needs to be consistent, easy to use and configure and be extensible.

Do not change implementation just yet. This file details all the changes necessary.

## Tasks

- Add config for schema validation.
- Define more types (e.g., for A2A, events).
- Add metrics for schema operations.
- Integrate with all packages for consistent data.
- Add error codes for validation failures.
- Update tests.
- Document as data contract layer in README.md.
