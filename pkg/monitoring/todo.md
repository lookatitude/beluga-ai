# Monitoring Package Redesign TODO

## Overview
The monitoring package is advanced but needs better integration with other packages, config validation, enhanced metrics, safety/ethics integration, error handling, updated tests, and improved documentation. It should be consistent, easy to use, configurable, and extensible. Do not change the implementation yet; use this TODO to plan the redesign.

## Detailed Tasks

1. **Integration with Other Packages**
   - Ensure all packages in the framework use monitoring via Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) injection. Inject monitoring dependencies as interfaces in constructors.

2. **Configuration Validation**
   - Add config validation for monitoring setups. Use structs with tags (mapstructure, yaml, env, validate) and validate at creation using a validator library.

3. **Enhance Metrics**
   - Enhance metrics for framework-wide events using OpenTelemetry (OTEL). Define counters and histograms with appropriate labels in metrics.go.

4. **Integrate Safety and Ethics**
   - Integrate safety and ethics monitoring with the server package for exposure, possibly through APIs or endpoints.

5. **Error Handling**
   - Add error handling for monitoring failures. Use custom error types with operation, error, and code fields. Respect context cancellation and wrap errors appropriately.

6. **Update Tests**
   - Update tests for cross-package monitoring. Use table-driven tests, mocks in internal/mock/, and include benchmarks for performance-critical parts.

7. **Documentation**
   - Document the package as the observability hub in README.md. Include package comments, function docs with examples, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.

8. **Consistency and Extensibility**
   - Align with core principles: ISP (small interfaces), DIP, SRP, Composition over Inheritance.
   - Make the package easy to use and configure with functional options and factories.
   - Design for extensibility, e.g., support multiple backends via providers/ directory if needed, following the standard package layout.

Follow the Beluga AI Framework design patterns for all changes, including observability by default (tracing, metrics, logging) and SemVer for evolution.
