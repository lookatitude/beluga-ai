## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer building AI applications with the Beluga AI Framework, I need the ChatModels package to achieve full compliance with framework standards while preserving its current runnable implementation and interface design. The package should provide unified chat model interactions across multiple providers with complete observability, proper error handling, and extensible architecture following the global registry pattern.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the ChatModels package has good interface design and runnable implementation, **When** analyzing against framework standards, **Then** specific compliance gaps should be identified and addressed
2. **Given** multiple chat model providers need to be supported, **When** extending the package, **Then** a global registry pattern should enable seamless provider registration and discovery
3. **Given** observability is critical for production usage, **When** using chat models in applications, **Then** full OpenTelemetry integration should provide comprehensive metrics, tracing, and logging
4. **Given** error handling consistency is required across the framework, **When** chat model operations fail, **Then** structured error handling with Op/Err/Code pattern should provide actionable error information
5. **Given** the current runnable interface works well, **When** implementing compliance improvements, **Then** existing functionality and API contracts must be preserved

### Edge Cases
- What happens when new chat model providers need different initialization patterns while maintaining global registry compliance?
- How does the system handle provider registration conflicts or duplicate provider names?
- How are framework compliance requirements balanced with preserving existing runnable interface behavior?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Global Registry Pattern Implementation
- **FR-001**: System MUST implement the global registry pattern for consistent chat model provider management and discovery
- **FR-002**: System MUST support dynamic provider registration through RegisterGlobal function for extensibility
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide NewProvider function for creating chat model instances from registered providers
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain thread-safe provider registry operations using proper synchronization primitives

#### OpenTelemetry Integration Completion  
- **FR-005**: System MUST implement complete OTEL metrics collection with RecordOperation method for all chat model operations
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide distributed tracing capabilities with proper span management for chat model interactions
- **FR-007**: System MUST support structured logging with context propagation across chat model operations  
- **FR-008**: System MUST include NoOpMetrics function for testing and development scenarios

#### Error Handling Standardization
- **FR-009**: System MUST implement comprehensive Op/Err/Code error pattern for all chat model operations
- **FR-010**: System MUST define standard error codes as constants for programmatic error handling
- **FR-011**: System MUST preserve error chains through Unwrap() method for proper error tracing
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide context-aware error messages with operation details for debugging

#### Interface and Runnable Preservation
- **FR-013**: System MUST preserve the current ChatModel interface design with MessageGenerator, StreamMessageHandler, ModelInfoProvider, and HealthChecker
- **FR-014**: System MUST maintain the core.Runnable embedding for consistency with framework patterns
- **FR-015**: System MUST preserve existing GenerateMessages and StreamMessages method signatures and behaviors
- **FR-016**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with current OpenAI provider implementation

#### Factory Pattern Enhancement
- **FR-017**: System MUST implement factory.go or registry.go file for centralized provider management
- **FR-018**: System MUST support provider creation with configuration validation and error handling
- **FR-019**: System MUST enable provider discovery and enumeration through factory methods
- **FR-020**: System MUST support provider-specific configuration while maintaining unified interface

#### Testing Infrastructure Validation
- **FR-021**: System MUST validate that existing AdvancedMockChatModel provides comprehensive testing capabilities
- **FR-022**: System MUST ensure advanced_test.go includes table-driven tests, concurrency testing, and performance benchmarks
- **FR-023**: System MUST provide interface compliance testing for all chat model provider implementations
- **FR-024**: System MUST support integration testing with other framework packages

#### Configuration and Options Management
- **FR-025**: System MUST maintain functional options pattern for chat model configuration
- **FR-026**: System MUST support provider-specific options while preserving unified configuration interface
- **FR-027**: System MUST validate configuration options with detailed error messages
- **FR-028**: System MUST provide default configuration values for streamlined usage

### Key Entities

- **ChatModel Interface**: Core abstraction combining MessageGenerator, StreamMessageHandler, ModelInfoProvider, HealthChecker, and Runnable capabilities
- **Provider Registry**: Global registry managing chat model provider registration, creation, and discovery with thread-safe operations  
- **OTEL Metrics**: Comprehensive observability integration providing metrics, tracing, and logging for all chat model operations
- **Error Handling System**: Structured error types with Op/Err/Code pattern, standard error codes, and proper error chain preservation
