# Feature Specification: Embeddings Package Analysis

**Feature Branch**: `008-for-the-embeddings`  
**Created**: October 5, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "For the 'embeddings' package: Analyze current (OpenAI/Ollama, global registry, performance testing). Ensure full patterns."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Description specifies analysis of embeddings package components
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: embeddings package, OpenAI/Ollama providers, global registry, performance testing, pattern compliance
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Analysis task focuses on verification scenarios
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable and focused on analysis outcomes
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY (analysis verification)
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Constitutional alignment**: Ensure requirements support ISP, DIP, SRP, and composition principles
5. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors (must align with Op/Err/Code pattern)
   - Integration requirements (consider OTEL observability needs)
   - Security/compliance needs
   - Provider extensibility requirements (if multi-provider package)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a development team member, I need to understand the current state of the embeddings package implementation, specifically verifying that OpenAI and Ollama providers are properly integrated, the global registry functions correctly, performance testing is comprehensive, and all framework design patterns are fully implemented.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the embeddings package exists, **When** I examine the OpenAI and Ollama provider implementations, **Then** I can confirm they follow consistent interface patterns and handle errors properly
2. **Given** the global registry system, **When** I test provider registration and retrieval, **Then** I can verify thread-safe operations and proper error handling for missing providers
3. **Given** performance testing exists, **When** I run the benchmark suite, **Then** I can validate comprehensive coverage of different scenarios and measurable performance metrics
4. **Given** framework design patterns, **When** I analyze the package structure, **Then** I can confirm full compliance with ISP, DIP, SRP, and composition principles

### Edge Cases
- What happens when analysis reveals pattern violations?
- How does the team handle findings that require architectural changes?
- What if performance testing reveals unacceptable bottlenecks?
- How are findings documented for stakeholder review?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Analysis MUST verify OpenAI provider implementation includes proper configuration management, error handling, and interface compliance
- **FR-002**: Analysis MUST verify Ollama provider implementation includes proper configuration management, error handling, and interface compliance
- **FR-003**: Analysis MUST verify global registry provides thread-safe provider registration and retrieval with proper error handling
- **FR-004**: Analysis MUST verify performance testing covers factory creation, provider operations, memory usage, concurrency, and throughput scenarios
- **FR-005**: Analysis MUST verify package structure follows framework standards with iface/, internal/, providers/, config.go, and metrics.go
- **FR-006**: Analysis MUST verify interface design follows ISP with focused methods and proper naming conventions
- **FR-007**: Analysis MUST verify configuration management uses structured config with validation, functional options, and proper defaults
- **FR-008**: Analysis MUST verify observability includes OpenTelemetry traces, metrics, and health checks
- **FR-009**: Analysis MUST verify error handling uses custom error types with codes, proper wrapping, and context awareness
- **FR-010**: Analysis MUST verify testing patterns include table-driven tests, mocks, and comprehensive coverage metrics
- **FR-011**: Analysis MUST verify documentation includes package comments, function docs, and README with usage examples

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Analysis Findings**: Records of pattern compliance verification, violations found, and recommendations
- **Performance Metrics**: Benchmark results, coverage statistics, and performance baselines
- **Provider Configurations**: Settings for OpenAI, Ollama, and mock providers with validation rules
- **Test Results**: Coverage reports, benchmark outputs, and compliance verification outcomes
