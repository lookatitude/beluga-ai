# Tasks: Embeddings Package Enhancements

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/008-for-the-embeddings/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart-updated.md

## Task Type Classification (CRITICAL - Read First!)

**CORRECTION/ENHANCEMENT TASKS (Type 3️⃣)**: Fix/improve EXISTING code in `pkg/` based on analysis findings
- **Goal**: Enhance existing embeddings package to achieve full constitutional compliance
- **File Targets**: Modify existing `pkg/embeddings/` files (add tests, update signatures, improve monitoring)
- **Task Verbs**: Fix, Update, Enhance, Add, Improve
- **Validation**: Run tests to verify enhancements, ensure no regressions

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Identify task type: CORRECTION/ENHANCEMENT (enhancing existing pkg/embeddings/)
2. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: Test coverage (62.9%→80%), metrics signature alignment, monitoring
3. Load design documents:
   → contracts/: 6 contract files → verification/validation tasks
   → data-model.md: 4 entities → enhancement/modeling tasks
   → quickstart-updated.md: 5+ scenarios → validation tasks
   → research.md: Technical decisions → implementation guidance
4. Generate tasks by enhancement phase:
   → Phase 1: Foundation (coverage 62.9%→75%) - factory & mock testing
   → Phase 2: Standards (coverage 75%→80%) - metrics & integration
   → Phase 3: Production (monitoring & docs) - performance & documentation
5. Apply correction rules:
   → Sequential within phases for safety
   → Parallel [P] for independent file modifications
   → Test additions before code modifications (TDD)
   → Coverage validation checkpoints between phases
6. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
7. Generate dependency graph and parallel examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts verified?
   → All entities enhanced?
   → All scenarios validated?
   → No regressions possible?
9. Return: SUCCESS (enhancement tasks ready for implementation)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description with file path`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)

   git commit -m "your comprehensive message above"
   git push origin 008-for-the-embeddings
   ```

3. **Create Pull Request**:
   - From `008-for-the-embeddings` branch to `develop` branch
   - Include coverage reports and constitutional compliance status
   - Reference enhancement plan and analysis reports

4. **Merge to develop**:
   - Ensure all tests pass with new coverage requirements
   - Verify performance benchmarks show no regressions
   - Confirm backward compatibility maintained

5. **Post-merge validation**:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   go test ./pkg/embeddings/... -v -cover
   go test ./pkg/embeddings -bench=. -benchmem
   go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html
   ```

**CRITICAL**: Do not proceed to next feature until this workflow is complete and validated.

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Coverage Analysis**:
   - Each coverage gap → specific test addition task
   - Coverage targets → validation checkpoint tasks

2. **From Constitutional Requirements**:
   - Each non-compliance → alignment task
   - Quality standards → enhancement tasks

3. **From Production Needs**:
   - Monitoring gaps → implementation tasks
   - Documentation needs → creation tasks

4. **Ordering**:
   - Foundation (coverage) → Standards (compliance) → Production (monitoring/docs)
   - Parallel execution within phases for independent tasks
   - Sequential validation checkpoints between phases
