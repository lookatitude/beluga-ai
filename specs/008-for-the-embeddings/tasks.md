# Tasks: Embeddings Package Corrections

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/008-for-the-embeddings/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: Go 1.21+, OTEL framework, multi-provider package structure
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: Analysis entities, correction plans, performance metrics
   → contracts/: Interface contracts and correction requirements
   → research.md: Framework compliance gaps and priorities
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Branch verification, dependency checks
   → Tests: Fix failing tests, add new test scenarios
   → Core: Implement Ollama dimension discovery
   → Integration: Cross-package testing, load testing
   → Polish: Documentation, final validation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Package**: `pkg/embeddings/` at repository root
- **Tests**: `pkg/embeddings/*_test.go` for unit tests
- **Integration**: `tests/integration/` for cross-package tests
- **Documentation**: `pkg/embeddings/README.md`

## Phase 3.1: Setup & Validation
- [x] T001 Verify current branch is `008-for-the-embeddings`
- [x] T002 Run full test suite to establish baseline (expect some failures)
- [x] T003 [P] Validate framework compliance with constitution checklist

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD + Constitutional Compliance) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
**CRITICAL: Fix existing failing tests and add new test coverage before implementation**
**CONSTITUTIONAL: Maintain test_utils.go and advanced_test.go standards**
- [x] T004 [P] Fix failing advanced_test.go rate limiting tests in `pkg/embeddings/advanced_test.go`
- [x] T005 [P] Fix failing advanced_test.go mock behavior tests in `pkg/embeddings/advanced_test.go`
- [x] T006 [P] Add Ollama dimension discovery tests in `pkg/embeddings/providers/ollama/ollama_test.go`
- [x] T007 [P] Add load testing benchmarks in `pkg/embeddings/benchmarks_test.go`
- [x] T008 [P] Add integration test for embeddings with vector stores in `tests/integration/test_embeddings_vectorstore.go`

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)
**CONSTITUTIONAL: Maintain OTEL metrics, structured errors, and interface compliance**
- [x] T009 Implement Ollama dimension querying in `pkg/embeddings/providers/ollama/ollama.go`
- [x] T010 [P] Add concurrent load testing utilities in `pkg/embeddings/test_utils.go`
- [x] T011 [P] Enhance mock provider with configurable load simulation in `pkg/embeddings/providers/mock/mock.go`

## Phase 3.4: Integration & Cross-Package Testing
- [x] T012 Create integration test suite for embeddings-vectorstore compatibility in `tests/integration/test_embeddings_vectorstore.go`
- [x] T013 Add performance regression detection in benchmark tests in `pkg/embeddings/benchmarks_test.go`
- [x] T014 [P] Implement load testing scenarios with realistic user patterns in `pkg/embeddings/advanced_test.go`

## Phase 3.5: Documentation & Polish ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] T015 [P] Enhance README.md with advanced configuration examples in `pkg/embeddings/README.md`
- [x] T016 [P] Add troubleshooting section to README.md in `pkg/embeddings/README.md`
- [x] T017 [P] Document load testing procedures in `pkg/embeddings/README.md`
- [x] T018 [P] Update provider-specific setup guides in `pkg/embeddings/README.md`

## Dependencies
- Constitutional compliance (T001-T003) before all other tasks
- Test fixes (T004-T005) before new test additions (T006-T008)
- Failing tests (T006-T008) before implementation (T009-T011)
- Core implementation (T009-T011) before integration (T012-T014)
- Documentation (T015-T018) can run in parallel with integration
- All tasks must complete before post-implementation workflow

## Parallel Execution Examples
```
# Launch T006-T008 together (new test scenarios):
Task: "Add Ollama dimension discovery tests in pkg/embeddings/providers/ollama/ollama_test.go"
Task: "Add load testing benchmarks in pkg/embeddings/benchmarks_test.go"
Task: "Add integration test for embeddings with vector stores in tests/integration/test_embeddings_vectorstore.go"

# Launch T015-T018 together (documentation enhancements):
Task: "Enhance README.md with advanced configuration examples in pkg/embeddings/README.md"
Task: "Add troubleshooting section to README.md in pkg/embeddings/README.md"
Task: "Document load testing procedures in pkg/embeddings/README.md"
Task: "Update provider-specific setup guides in pkg/embeddings/README.md"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing corrections
- Commit after each task completion
- Focus on framework corrections identified in research.md
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing interfaces

   git commit -m "your comprehensive message above"
   git push origin 008-for-the-embeddings
   ```

3. **Create Pull Request**:
   - From `008-for-the-embeddings` branch to `develop` branch
   - Include implementation summary and constitutional compliance status
   - Reference embeddings package correction requirements

4. **Merge to develop**:
   - Ensure all tests pass in CI/CD
   - Merge PR to develop branch
   - Verify functionality is preserved post-merge

5. **Post-merge validation**:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   go test ./pkg/embeddings/... -v -cover
   go test ./tests/integration/... -v
   go test ./pkg/embeddings/... -bench=. -benchmem
   ```

**CRITICAL**: Do not proceed to next feature until this workflow is complete and validated.
