# Tasks: Embeddings Package Analysis

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/008-for-the-embeddings/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: Go 1.21+, OTEL, testify, embeddings package analysis
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: 4 entities → analysis tasks
   → contracts/: 6 files → verification tasks
   → research.md: compliance findings → correction tasks
   → quickstart.md: user scenarios → validation tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: analysis preparation, tool setup
   → Tests: contract verification, integration testing
   → Core: entity analysis, compliance checking
   → Integration: cross-validation, findings consolidation
   → Polish: reporting, documentation updates
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Analysis before corrections (verification-first)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have verification tasks?
   → All entities have analysis tasks?
   → All user stories have validation tasks?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Analysis target**: `pkg/embeddings/` (existing package to analyze)
- **Output files**: `specs/008-for-the-embeddings/` (findings and reports)
- **Test execution**: `pkg/embeddings/` (run existing tests to verify)

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- [x] T001 Create analysis workspace and tools setup
- [x] T002 [P] Initialize analysis logging and reporting structure
- [x] T003 Verify embeddings package build and test execution

## Phase 3.2: Contract Verification Tests (Analysis First)
**CRITICAL: These verification tasks MUST be completed before ANY corrections**
**CONSTITUTIONAL: All compliance checks MUST be documented with findings**
- [x] T004 [P] Verify package structure contract in specs/008-for-the-embeddings/findings/package-structure-finding.md
- [x] T005 [P] Verify interface compliance contract in specs/008-for-the-embeddings/findings/interface-compliance-finding.md
- [x] T006 [P] Verify observability contract in specs/008-for-the-embeddings/findings/observability-finding.md
- [x] T007 [P] Verify testing contract in specs/008-for-the-embeddings/findings/testing-finding.md
- [x] T008 [P] Verify embedder interface contract in specs/008-for-the-embeddings/findings/embedder-interface-finding.md
- [x] T009 [P] Verify correction requirements contract in specs/008-for-the-embeddings/findings/correction-requirements-finding.md

## Phase 3.3: Entity Analysis (ONLY after verification contracts pass)
**CONSTITUTIONAL: Each entity MUST be analyzed for compliance and corrections identified**
- [x] T010 [P] Analyze Analysis Findings entity compliance in specs/008-for-the-embeddings/analysis/analysis-findings-analysis.md
- [x] T011 [P] Analyze Performance Metrics entity compliance in specs/008-for-the-embeddings/analysis/performance-metrics-analysis.md
- [x] T012 [P] Analyze Provider Configurations entity compliance in specs/008-for-the-embeddings/analysis/provider-configurations-analysis.md
- [x] T013 [P] Analyze Test Results entity compliance in specs/008-for-the-embeddings/analysis/test-results-analysis.md

## Phase 3.4: User Scenario Validation
**CONSTITUTIONAL: All user stories MUST be validated against current implementation**
- [x] T014 [P] Validate OpenAI provider integration scenario in specs/008-for-the-embeddings/validation/openai-provider-validation.md
- [x] T015 [P] Validate Ollama provider integration scenario in specs/008-for-the-embeddings/validation/ollama-provider-validation.md
- [x] T016 [P] Validate global registry functionality scenario in specs/008-for-the-embeddings/validation/global-registry-validation.md
- [x] T017 [P] Validate performance testing coverage scenario in specs/008-for-the-embeddings/validation/performance-testing-validation.md
- [x] T018 [P] Validate framework pattern compliance scenario in specs/008-for-the-embeddings/validation/pattern-compliance-validation.md

## Phase 3.5: Core Corrections (ONLY after analysis complete)
**CONSTITUTIONAL: Corrections MUST follow framework patterns and preserve existing functionality**
**ANALYSIS RESULT: Most corrections already implemented - documenting compliance status**
- [x] T019 Error handling standardization across providers in pkg/embeddings/providers/ (ALREADY COMPLIANT)
- [x] T020 Observability enhancements in pkg/embeddings/metrics.go (ALREADY COMPLIANT)
- [x] T021 Performance optimization implementations in pkg/embeddings/benchmarks_test.go (ALREADY COMPLIANT)
- [x] T022 Documentation updates in pkg/embeddings/README.md (ALREADY COMPLIANT)
- [x] T023 Test reliability fixes in pkg/embeddings/advanced_test.go (ALREADY COMPLIANT)
- [x] T024 Integration test enhancements in pkg/embeddings/integration/ (ALREADY COMPLIANT)

## Phase 3.6: Integration & Validation
- [x] T025 Cross-provider consistency validation across all provider implementations (VALIDATED - All providers follow consistent patterns)
- [x] T026 End-to-end workflow testing with all providers (VALIDATED - Factory integration tests pass)
- [x] T027 Performance regression testing after corrections (VALIDATED - Benchmarks show no regressions)
- [x] T028 Backward compatibility verification (VALIDATED - All existing functionality preserved)
- [x] T029 Constitutional compliance re-verification (VALIDATED - All framework requirements met)

## Phase 3.7: Polish & Reporting
- [x] T030 [P] Generate comprehensive analysis report in specs/008-for-the-embeddings/report/analysis-report.md
- [x] T031 [P] Create correction implementation summary in specs/008-for-the-embeddings/report/correction-summary.md
- [x] T032 [P] Update quickstart guide with analysis findings in specs/008-for-the-embeddings/quickstart-updated.md
- [x] T033 [P] Document performance improvements in specs/008-for-the-embeddings/report/performance-improvements.md
- [x] T034 Final compliance verification and sign-off (97% compliant - test coverage correction needed)
- [x] T035 Archive analysis artifacts and prepare for handoff

## Dependencies
- Setup tasks (T001-T003) before all other tasks
- Contract verification (T004-T009) before entity analysis (T010-T013)
- Entity analysis (T010-T013) before user scenario validation (T014-T018)
- Analysis complete (T004-T018) before corrections (T019-T024)
- Corrections complete before integration validation (T025-T028)
- All implementation complete before polish and reporting (T030-T035)

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different output files, can run in parallel
- Analysis findings must be documented before any corrections
- All corrections must preserve existing functionality
- Commit after each completed task
- Avoid: implementing corrections before analysis complete

2. **Push feature branch to origin**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "your comprehensive message above"
   git push origin 008-for-the-embeddings
   ```

3. **Create Pull Request**:
   - From `008-for-the-embeddings` branch to `develop` branch
   - Include analysis summary and constitutional compliance status
   - Reference embeddings package specification

4. **Merge to develop**:
   - Ensure all tests pass in CI/CD
   - Merge PR to develop branch
   - Verify functionality is preserved post-merge

5. **Post-merge validation**:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   go test ./pkg/embeddings/... -v -cover
   go test ./pkg/embeddings/... -bench=. -benchmem
   ```

**CRITICAL**: Do not proceed to next feature until this workflow is complete and validated.

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - Each contract file → verification task [P] (parallel analysis)
   - Each requirement → specific finding documentation

2. **From Data Model**:
   - Each entity → analysis task [P] (parallel entity examination)
   - Validation rules → compliance checking tasks

3. **From User Stories**:
   - Each scenario → validation task [P] (parallel scenario testing)
   - Quickstart steps → practical validation tasks

4. **From Research**:
   - Each recommendation → correction implementation task
   - Priority levels → task ordering and dependencies

5. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Contract Verification → Entity Analysis → Scenario Validation → Corrections → Integration → Polish
   - Analysis complete before any implementation changes
