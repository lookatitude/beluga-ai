# Data Model: Embeddings Package Corrections

**Date**: October 5, 2025
**Purpose**: Define entities and data structures for embeddings package analysis and corrections

## Core Entities

### Analysis Findings
**Purpose**: Records of pattern compliance verification and identified issues
**Fields**:
- `finding_id`: string (unique identifier)
- `component`: string (provider/factory/interface/etc.)
- `severity`: enum (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- `category`: enum (STRUCTURE/PRINCIPLE/OBSERVABILITY/TESTING/DOCUMENTATION)
- `description`: string (detailed finding description)
- `impact`: string (business/technical impact)
- `recommendation`: string (suggested correction)
- `status`: enum (IDENTIFIED/PLANNED/IMPLEMENTED/VERIFIED)
- `created_at`: timestamp
- `updated_at`: timestamp

**Relationships**:
- Many-to-one with `Correction Plan` (findings grouped by correction areas)
- One-to-many with `Test Results` (findings validated by test outcomes)

**Validation Rules**:
- `finding_id` must be unique and follow pattern `EMB-{category}-{number}`
- `severity` cannot be null
- `description` and `recommendation` must be non-empty strings
- `status` must transition logically (IDENTIFIED → PLANNED → IMPLEMENTED → VERIFIED)

### Correction Plan
**Purpose**: Structured roadmap for implementing identified corrections
**Fields**:
- `plan_id`: string (unique identifier)
- `title`: string (correction area title)
- `description`: string (detailed plan description)
- `priority`: enum (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- `effort_estimate`: enum (SMALL/MEDIUM/LARGE)
- `dependencies`: []string (list of dependent correction plan IDs)
- `status`: enum (PLANNED/IN_PROGRESS/COMPLETED)
- `assigned_to`: string (optional assignee)
- `due_date`: timestamp (optional)
- `created_at`: timestamp
- `updated_at`: timestamp

**Relationships**:
- One-to-many with `Analysis Findings` (plans address multiple findings)
- Many-to-one with `Implementation Task` (plans broken into tasks)

### Performance Metrics
**Purpose**: Benchmark results and performance baselines
**Fields**:
- `metric_id`: string (unique identifier)
- `test_name`: string (benchmark test identifier)
- `provider`: string (openai/ollama/mock)
- `operation`: string (embed_query/embed_documents/get_dimension)
- `batch_size`: int (number of documents for batch operations)
- `duration_ms`: float64 (operation duration in milliseconds)
- `memory_mb`: float64 (memory usage in MB)
- `success`: bool (operation success flag)
- `error_message`: string (error details if failed)
- `timestamp`: timestamp

**Relationships**:
- Many-to-one with `Test Results` (metrics collected during test execution)
- Referenced by performance validation requirements

### Test Results
**Purpose**: Comprehensive test execution outcomes
**Fields**:
- `test_id`: string (unique identifier)
- `test_type`: enum (UNIT/INTEGRATION/BENCHMARK/LOAD)
- `component`: string (specific component being tested)
- `test_name`: string (test function/method name)
- `status`: enum (PASS/FAIL/SKIP)
- `duration_ms`: float64 (test execution time)
- `coverage_percent`: float64 (code coverage percentage)
- `error_message`: string (failure details)
- `timestamp`: timestamp

**Relationships**:
- One-to-many with `Performance Metrics` (benchmark tests generate metrics)
- Many-to-one with `Analysis Findings` (tests validate findings)

### Provider Configurations
**Purpose**: Settings for different embedding providers
**Fields**:
- `config_id`: string (unique identifier)
- `provider_type`: enum (OPENAI/OLLAMA/MOCK)
- `model_name`: string (specific model identifier)
- `api_key`: string (encrypted/sensitive - OpenAI only)
- `server_url`: string (Ollama server endpoint)
- `timeout_seconds`: int (request timeout)
- `max_retries`: int (retry attempts)
- `enabled`: bool (provider availability flag)
- `created_at`: timestamp
- `updated_at`: timestamp

**Relationships**:
- Referenced by provider implementations
- Validated against framework configuration standards

## State Transitions

### Analysis Finding States
```
IDENTIFIED → PLANNED → IMPLEMENTED → VERIFIED
     ↓         ↓
  CANCELLED  DEFERRED
```

### Correction Plan States
```
PLANNED → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED
           ↓
       CANCELLED
```

### Test Result States
```
QUEUED → RUNNING → PASS|FAIL|SKIP
```

## Validation Rules Summary

### Business Rules
1. High-severity findings must be addressed before medium/low priority items
2. All correction plans must have at least one associated finding
3. Performance metrics must meet established baselines (<100ms p95, <100MB memory)
4. Test coverage must maintain 90%+ across all components

### Data Integrity Rules
1. All timestamps must be valid and in chronological order
2. Finding IDs must follow the prescribed format
3. Provider configurations must pass validation before use
4. Error messages must be non-empty when status is FAIL

### Framework Compliance Rules
1. All entities must support OTEL observability
2. Error handling must follow Op/Err/Code pattern
3. Configuration must use functional options
4. Testing must include table-driven tests and mocks

## Integration Points

### With Framework Monitoring
- Performance metrics feed into framework-wide observability
- Test results integrate with CI/CD quality gates
- Configuration changes trigger validation workflows

### With Development Workflow
- Findings generate automated task creation
- Correction plans integrate with project management
- Test results drive development priorities

### With Other Packages
- Embeddings configurations integrate with vector store requirements
- Performance baselines inform scaling decisions
- Test patterns provide templates for other packages
