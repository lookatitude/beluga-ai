# Data Model: Embeddings Package Analysis

**Feature**: Embeddings Package Analysis | **Date**: October 5, 2025

## Overview
This analysis focuses on documenting the data entities and models used within the embeddings package, validating their compliance with framework patterns, and identifying any corrections needed.

## Core Entities

### Analysis Findings
**Purpose**: Records of pattern compliance verification, violations found, and recommendations
**Fields**:
- `finding_id`: string (unique identifier for each finding)
- `category`: string (structure/interface/error_handling/observability/testing/documentation)
- `severity`: string (critical/high/medium/low)
- `description`: string (detailed description of the finding)
- `location`: string (file path and line number where issue was found)
- `recommendation`: string (suggested correction or improvement)
- `status`: string (open/in_progress/resolved)
- `validation_method`: string (how the finding was verified)

**Relationships**:
- 1:N with Performance Metrics (each finding may reference performance data)
- 1:N with Provider Configurations (findings may be provider-specific)

**Validation Rules**:
- `finding_id` must be unique and follow format `EMB-{category}-{number}`
- `category` must be one of the predefined values
- `severity` must follow framework severity guidelines
- `status` defaults to "open"

### Performance Metrics
**Purpose**: Benchmark results, coverage statistics, and performance baselines
**Fields**:
- `metric_id`: string (unique identifier)
- `benchmark_name`: string (name of the benchmark test)
- `operation_type`: string (factory_creation/embed_generation/memory_usage/concurrency/throughput)
- `value`: float64 (measured value)
- `unit`: string (ms/ops/sec/MB/req/s/etc)
- `timestamp`: time.Time (when measurement was taken)
- `environment`: string (test environment details)

**Relationships**:
- N:1 with Analysis Findings (metrics support findings validation)

**Validation Rules**:
- `metric_id` follows format `PERF-{operation}-{timestamp}`
- `value` must be positive number
- `unit` must be valid measurement unit

### Provider Configurations
**Purpose**: Settings for OpenAI, Ollama, and mock providers with validation rules
**Fields**:
- `provider_type`: string (openai/ollama/mock)
- `config_section`: string (main provider configuration section)
- `setting_name`: string (individual configuration parameter)
- `setting_value`: interface{} (current configured value)
- `validation_rule`: string (validation constraints)
- `compliance_status`: string (compliant/needs_correction)
- `correction_needed`: string (description of required changes)

**Relationships**:
- 1:N with Analysis Findings (configuration issues become findings)

**Validation Rules**:
- `provider_type` must be one of supported providers
- `compliance_status` must be validated against framework standards

### Test Results
**Purpose**: Coverage reports, benchmark outputs, and compliance verification outcomes
**Fields**:
- `test_id`: string (unique test identifier)
- `test_type`: string (unit/integration/benchmark/compliance)
- `test_name`: string (specific test function or scenario)
- `status`: string (pass/fail/error)
- `coverage_percentage`: float64 (code coverage achieved)
- `execution_time`: time.Duration (how long test took to run)
- `error_message`: string (failure details if applicable)

**Relationships**:
- N:1 with Analysis Findings (test results validate findings)

**Validation Rules**:
- `coverage_percentage` must be >= 80% for framework compliance
- `status` must be tracked for all test executions

## State Transitions

### Analysis Workflow States
1. **Initialized** → Analysis setup complete
2. **Scanning** → Code structure examination in progress
3. **Validating** → Compliance checks being performed
4. **Reporting** → Findings being documented
5. **Complete** → Analysis finished with recommendations

### Finding Resolution States
1. **Open** → Finding identified and documented
2. **In_Progress** → Correction work underway
3. **Resolved** → Finding addressed successfully
4. **Closed** → Finding reviewed and accepted as-is

## Validation Rules Summary

### Structural Compliance
- Package must follow exact framework layout
- All required files must be present
- Directory structure must match constitution requirements

### Interface Compliance
- Embedder interface must follow ISP principles
- Method signatures must be focused and minimal
- Naming conventions must be followed

### Error Handling Compliance
- All errors must use Op/Err/Code pattern
- Error chains must be preserved through wrapping
- Error codes must be standardized

### Testing Compliance
- Test coverage must be >= 80%
- Benchmarks must cover performance-critical paths
- Table-driven tests must be used for complex logic
