# Feature Specification: Schema Package Standards Adherence

**Feature Branch**: `002-for-the-schema`  
**Created**: October 5, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "For the 'schema' package: Analyze current (centralized data structures, validation, type safety, message/document testing utilities) from README.md. Identify standards gaps (e.g., metrics.go, advanced_test.go). Specify adherence: Add required files/structure, OTEL, testing. Preserve schema functionalities, flexibility for extensions."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Analysis of current schema package structure and capabilities
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: centralized data structures ‚úì, validation ‚úì, type safety ‚úì, testing utilities ‚úì
   ‚Üí Identify gaps: benchmark tests, mock organization, health checks, advanced testing patterns
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All requirements clear from design patterns document
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Framework developers need standards-compliant schema package
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement addresses specific design pattern compliance
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Schema types, testing infrastructure, observability components
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Implementation ready, preserves existing functionality
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a **framework developer** working with the Beluga AI Framework, I need the schema package to fully comply with the established design patterns so that I can rely on consistent observability, testing infrastructure, and maintainability standards across all framework components. The schema package, being the central data contract layer, must exemplify best practices while preserving its current comprehensive functionality and extensibility.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a framework developer needs to create performance benchmarks, **When** they examine the schema package, **Then** they find comprehensive benchmark tests for all performance-critical operations
2. **Given** a developer needs to mock schema interfaces for testing, **When** they look for mock implementations, **Then** they find organized mocks in `internal/mock/` directory with proper code generation
3. **Given** a system operator needs to monitor schema package health, **When** they check health endpoints, **Then** the schema package provides health check implementations where applicable
4. **Given** a developer extends the schema package, **When** they run tests, **Then** they find table-driven tests with comprehensive coverage including edge cases
5. **Given** a developer needs observability, **When** they use schema factory functions, **Then** they get complete OTEL tracing with proper span management
6. **Given** a developer needs to understand the package structure, **When** they examine the codebase, **Then** they find it matches the standard package layout with proper documentation

### Edge Cases
- What happens when benchmark tests are run in CI/CD environments with resource constraints?
- How does the system handle mock generation failures or outdated mocks?
- What occurs when health checks fail in production environments?
- How are performance regressions detected through benchmark comparison?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide comprehensive benchmark tests for all performance-critical operations (message creation, validation, serialization)
- **FR-002**: System MUST organize mock implementations in `internal/mock/` directory following standard package layout
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide automated mock generation through code generation tools
- **FR-004**: System MUST implement health check interfaces for monitoring package health where applicable
- **FR-005**: System MUST enhance existing table-driven tests with comprehensive edge case coverage
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide complete OTEL tracing with proper span management in all factory functions
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain all existing schema functionality without breaking changes
- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve current extensibility patterns for custom message types and providers
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure all new testing infrastructure integrates seamlessly with existing tests
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide clear documentation for new testing and observability features
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate that all configuration structs follow validation tag patterns consistently
- **FR-012**: System MUST ensure error handling follows the established Op/Err/Code pattern throughout
- **FR-013**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility for all public interfaces and factory functions
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide migration guides for any new testing or observability patterns

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Benchmark Suite**: Performance testing infrastructure for schema operations, includes memory allocation tracking and operation timing
- **Mock Infrastructure**: Organized mock implementations for all schema interfaces, supports code generation and test isolation
- **Health Check Components**: Health monitoring for schema validation, metrics collection, and configuration integrity
- **Enhanced Test Suite**: Extended table-driven tests with comprehensive edge case coverage and error scenario validation
- **Tracing Infrastructure**: Complete OTEL span management for factory functions and validation operations
- **Documentation Updates**: Enhanced documentation covering new testing patterns, observability features, and usage examples
