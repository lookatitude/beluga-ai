# Tasks: Schema Package Standards Adherence

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-for-the-schema/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (✅), research.md (✅), data-model.md (✅), contracts/ (✅)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✅
   → Extract: Go 1.24.0, testify/mock, OTEL, validator
2. Load design documents ✅:
   → data-model.md: BenchmarkSuite, MockInfrastructure, HealthCheck entities
   → contracts/: interface_contracts.go, test_contracts.go
   → research.md: mockery tool, benchmark patterns, OTEL decisions
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: mock generation tools, benchmark infrastructure
   → Tests: comprehensive test suites, mock implementations
   → Core: health checks, enhanced metrics, validation
   → Integration: OTEL tracing, constitutional compliance
   → Polish: performance verification, documentation
4. Apply constitutional rules:
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
   → Constitutional files (test_utils.go, advanced_test.go) priority
   → OTEL metrics mandatory, structured errors required
```

## Dependencies
### Constitutional Requirements (Critical Path)
- T004-T005 (constitutional testing files) before all other tests
- T006-T014 (TDD tests) before T015-T032 (implementations)
- T028-T029 (OTEL metrics + errors) before integration tests

### Mock Infrastructure
- T001-T002 (mockery setup) before T009-T012 (mock tests) before T015-T019 (mock implementation)
- T019 (go generate) before T032 (build integration)

### Benchmark Infrastructure  
- T003 (benchmark setup) before T006-T008 (benchmark tests) before T020-T023 (benchmark implementation)

### Health Monitoring
- T024 (health interfaces) blocks T025-T027 (health implementation) blocks T030 (integration)

   ```

2. **Push feature branch to origin**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "your comprehensive message above"
   git push origin 002-for-the-schema
   ```

3. **Create Pull Request**:
   - From `002-for-the-schema` branch to `develop` branch
   - Include implementation summary and constitutional compliance status
   - Reference schema package enhancement specifications

4. **Merge to develop**:
   - Ensure all tests pass in CI/CD
   - Merge PR to develop branch
   - Verify functionality is preserved post-merge

5. **Post-merge validation**:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   go test ./pkg/schema/... -v
   go test ./tests/integration/... -run="*Schema*" -v
   ```

**CRITICAL**: Do not proceed to next feature until this workflow is complete and validated.
