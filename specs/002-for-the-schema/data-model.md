- **MetricsHealthChecker**: Validates OTEL metrics collection
- **MemoryHealthChecker**: Monitors for memory leaks in long-running processes

**Key Attributes**:
- `componentName` (string): Name of component being monitored
- `healthStatus` (HealthStatus): Current health status (Healthy, Warning, Critical)
- `lastCheck` (time.Time): Time of last health check
- `errorMessage` (string): Description of any health issues
- `checkInterval` (time.Duration): How often health checks run

**Validation Rules**:
- Health checks must complete within reasonable time limits
- Health status must be accurately reported
- Error messages must be informative and actionable
- Health checks must not impact package performance

### 4. Enhanced Test Suite
**Description**: Extended table-driven tests with comprehensive edge case coverage  
**Purpose**: Ensure complete test coverage including error scenarios and edge cases

**Components**:
- **MessageTestSuite**: Comprehensive tests for all message types and operations
- **DocumentTestSuite**: Complete test coverage for document operations
- **ConfigurationTestSuite**: Validation tests for all configuration scenarios
- **ErrorHandlingTestSuite**: Tests for all error conditions and edge cases
- **IntegrationTestSuite**: Cross-package interaction tests

**Key Attributes**:
- `testCategory` (string): Category of test (unit, integration, error handling)
- `testCoverage` (float64): Code coverage percentage
- `edgeCasesCount` (int): Number of edge cases covered
- `errorScenariosCount` (int): Number of error scenarios tested
- `tableTestsCount` (int): Number of table-driven test cases

**Validation Rules**:
- Must achieve 100% test coverage for public methods
- All error conditions must be tested
- Edge cases must be comprehensively covered
- Tests must follow table-driven patterns
- Integration tests must validate cross-package interactions

### 5. Tracing Infrastructure
**Description**: Complete OTEL span management for factory functions and validation operations  
**Purpose**: Provide distributed tracing capabilities for debugging and performance monitoring

**Components**:
- **FactoryTracing**: Span management for all factory functions
- **ValidationTracing**: Tracing for schema validation operations  
- **MessageTracing**: Tracing for message creation and processing
- **ConfigurationTracing**: Tracing for configuration loading and validation

**Key Attributes**:
- `spanName` (string): Name of the trace span
- `operation` (string): Operation being traced
- `attributes` (map[string]interface{}): Span attributes
- `duration` (time.Duration): Span execution time
- `status` (SpanStatus): Success/error status of operation

**Validation Rules**:
- All public factory functions must include tracing
- Spans must include relevant attributes (message type, operation result, etc.)
- Context must be properly propagated
- Span completion and error recording must be handled correctly
- Performance overhead from tracing must be minimal

### 6. Documentation Updates
**Description**: Enhanced documentation covering new testing patterns, observability features, and usage examples  
**Purpose**: Provide clear guidance for using new infrastructure components

**Components**:
