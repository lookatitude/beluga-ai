# Implementation Plan: Config Package Full Compliance

**Branch**: `003-for-the-config` | **Date**: October 5, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-for-the-config/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code, or `AGENTS.md` for all other agents).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

**Structure Decision**: Single Go package structure with enhanced provider registry, health checks, and comprehensive testing. Leverages existing standard layout with additions for constitutional compliance.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh cursor`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- **Contract-based tasks**:
  - registry.go → registry implementation + tests [P]
  - health.go → health checker implementation + tests [P] 
  - provider.go → enhanced provider interfaces + tests [P]
  - validation.go → comprehensive validator + tests [P]
  - loader.go → enhanced loader + tests [P]
- **Entity-based tasks**: 
  - Registry struct implementation [P]
  - Enhanced Provider implementations [P]
  - Health monitoring system [P]
  - Validation engine with custom rules [P]
  - Configuration migration utilities [P]
- **Infrastructure tasks**:
  - Op/Err/Code error handling implementation
  - Enhanced OTEL metrics and tracing
  - Hot-reload file watching system
  - Integration test framework setup

**Ordering Strategy**:
- **Phase A (Parallel)**: Core interfaces and error types
- **Phase B**: Registry and health systems (depends on Phase A)
- **Phase C**: Enhanced providers and validation (depends on Phase A,B)
- **Phase D**: Loader and migration (depends on all previous)
- **Phase E**: Integration tests and performance validation

**Key Dependencies**:
- Error types → All implementations
- Registry → Provider creation
- Health checker → All components
- Validator → Configuration loading
- Integration tests → All implementations

**Estimated Output**: 
- 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md
- 15+ parallel tasks marked [P] for concurrent execution
- 8-10 integration test scenarios
- 5+ performance benchmark tasks

**Performance Validation Tasks**:
- Load time benchmarks (<10ms goal)
- Validation speed tests (<1ms goal)  
- Concurrent operation stress tests (10k ops/sec goal)
- Memory usage validation (<5MB footprint goal)

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS (with documented implementation needs)
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS (design addresses all gaps)
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented
