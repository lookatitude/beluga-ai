# Tasks: Config Package Full Compliance

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-for-the-config/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (✅), research.md (✅), data-model.md (✅), contracts/ (✅), quickstart.md (✅)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✅
   → Extract: Go 1.21+, Viper, OpenTelemetry, testify, validator, mapstructure
2. Load design documents ✅:
   → data-model.md: Config, Provider, Registry, Validator, Metrics, Loader, HealthChecker entities
   → contracts/: registry.go, health.go, provider.go, loader.go, validation.go
   → research.md: Provider registry pattern, health checks, OTEL integration, error handling
   → quickstart.md: Usage scenarios and integration test cases
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Constitutional file structure preparation
   → Tests: Contract tests, integration tests (TDD approach)
   → Core: Registry, health checks, enhanced validation, OTEL metrics
   → Integration: Provider integration, loader orchestration
   → Polish: Performance validation, documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
   → Constitutional compliance files prioritized
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001-T045)
6. Dependencies: Setup → Tests → Core → Integration → Polish
```

2. **Push feature branch to origin**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "your comprehensive message above"
   git push origin 003-for-the-config
   ```

3. **Create Pull Request**:
   - From `003-for-the-config` branch to `develop` branch
   - Include implementation summary and constitutional compliance status
   - Reference config package constitutional compliance specifications

4. **Merge to develop**:
   - Ensure all tests pass in CI/CD
   - Merge PR to develop branch
   - Verify functionality is preserved post-merge

5. **Post-merge validation**:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   go test ./pkg/config/... -v
   go test ./tests/integration/... -run="*Config*" -v
   ```

**CRITICAL**: Do not proceed to next feature until this workflow is complete and validated.

## Dependencies

### Critical Path (Sequential)
- T001-T003 (constitutional structure) before all other tasks
- T004-T015 (TDD tests) before T016-T037 (implementations)
- T016-T020 (core components) before T021-T028 (provider integration)
- T025-T027 (loader implementation) depends on T017-T019 (registry, validator, health)

### Constitutional Requirements
- T002-T003, T016 (errors.go, config.go, metrics.go) required for constitutional compliance
- T004-T005 (test_utils.go, advanced_test.go) before any other tests
- T020, T029-T032 (OTEL integration) required for observability compliance

### Provider Integration Dependencies
- T017 (registry) before T021-T024 (provider enhancements)
- T018-T019 (validator, health checker) before T025-T027 (loader integration)
- T028 (hot-reload) depends on T025 (enhanced loader)

### Testing Dependencies
- T006-T010 (contract tests) can run in parallel after T004-T005 complete
- T011-T015 (integration tests) depend on contract interfaces being defined
- T038-T042 (performance tests) depend on T016-T037 (implementations)

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Phase 3.2 - Constitutional Testing (All Parallel)
```bash
# Launch T006-T010 together (different contract test files):
Task: "Contract test for ProviderRegistry interface in tests/contract/registry_test.go"
Task: "Contract test for HealthChecker interface in tests/contract/health_test.go"  
Task: "Contract test for ConfigValidator interface in tests/contract/validation_test.go"
Task: "Contract test for ConfigLoader interface in tests/contract/loader_test.go"
Task: "Contract test for Provider interface in tests/contract/provider_test.go"
```

### Phase 3.3 - Constitutional Implementation (Mostly Parallel)
```bash
# Launch T016-T020 together (different constitutional components):
Task: "Create constitutional metrics.go with OTEL integration"
Task: "Implement ProviderRegistry struct with thread-safe operations"
Task: "Implement ConfigValidator with custom validation rules"
Task: "Implement HealthChecker with status reporting"
Task: "Implement enhanced Metrics struct with config-specific metrics"
```

### Phase 3.4-3.5 - Advanced Features (All Parallel)
```bash  
# Launch T033-T037 together (different enhancement areas):
Task: "Implement configuration migration utilities in internal/migration/migrator.go"
Task: "Add cross-field validation rules for complex configuration relationships"
Task: "Implement configuration caching with TTL support in internal/cache/cache.go"
Task: "Add configuration versioning support with backward compatibility"
Task: "Implement provider lifecycle management in registry.go"
```

## Performance Targets (From Research)
- **Configuration Loading**: <10ms per load operation
- **Provider Resolution**: <1ms per provider resolution from registry  
- **Validation Time**: <1ms per validation operation
- **Throughput**: 10k configuration operations per second
- **Memory Footprint**: <5MB total package footprint
- **Health Check Overhead**: <10% impact on normal operations

## Constitutional Validation Commands
```bash
# T038-T042 Performance benchmark commands
go test ./pkg/config/... -bench=BenchmarkConfigLoad -benchmem
go test ./pkg/config/... -bench=BenchmarkProviderRegistry -benchmem
go test ./pkg/config/... -bench=BenchmarkValidation -benchmem

# T045 Constitutional compliance verification
go test ./pkg/config/... -v
go test ./tests/integration/... -run="*Config*" -v

# Full package validation
go test ./pkg/... -run="*Config*" -v  # Test all packages using config
```

## Config Package Specific Notes
- **Critical**: Preserve existing multi-provider functionality (Viper, Composite, custom providers)
- **Performance**: Configuration loading is application startup critical, optimize for speed
- **Testing**: Config testing utilities will be used by other packages for configuration testing
- **Constitutional Compliance**: Config package must exemplify provider registry patterns
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: All configuration loading APIs must remain unchanged
