# Feature Specification: Config Package Full Compliance

**Feature Branch**: `003-for-the-config`  
**Created**: October 5, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "For the 'config' package: Analyze current (validation, env vars, defaults, provider testing) from README.md. Gaps in patterns (e.g., registry if applicable, full testing). Specify full compliance, preserve config flexibility."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Key concepts: config package compliance, validation, env vars, defaults, testing, registry
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: developers, config package, providers, registry
   ‚Üí Actions: validate, load, test, register, extend
   ‚Üí Data: configuration structures, providers, validation rules
   ‚Üí Constraints: preserve flexibility, full compliance with design patterns
3. No unclear aspects identified - all requirements are clear
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow: developer uses config package with full pattern compliance
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities: Config, Provider, Registry, Validator, Metrics
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All items pass - no implementation details, focused on requirements
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Constitutional alignment**: Ensure requirements support ISP, DIP, SRP, and composition principles
5. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors (must align with Op/Err/Code pattern)
   - Integration requirements (consider OTEL observability needs)
   - Security/compliance needs
   - Provider extensibility requirements (if multi-provider package)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
**As a framework developer**, I want the config package to fully comply with Beluga AI Framework design patterns so that I can confidently use it for robust, observable, and extensible configuration management while preserving the flexibility to customize configuration sources, validation rules, and provider implementations.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I need to load configuration from multiple sources, **When** I use the config package, **Then** it provides a unified interface with proper error handling, validation, and observability
2. **Given** I want to register custom configuration providers, **When** I use a provider registry, **Then** providers are discoverable and manageable through a centralized system
3. **Given** I need comprehensive testing of my configuration setup, **When** I use the testing utilities, **Then** I can test all scenarios including edge cases, performance, and provider behavior
4. **Given** I want health monitoring of configuration systems, **When** I implement health checks, **Then** the system reports configuration health status accurately
5. **Given** I need to migrate between config versions, **When** I use migration utilities, **Then** the transition is seamless with proper validation and rollback capabilities

### Edge Cases
- What happens when multiple providers conflict on the same configuration key?
- How does the system handle partial configuration failures during composite provider operations?
- What occurs when environment variables contain malformed data that fails validation?
- How does the system behave when configuration files are modified during runtime?
- What happens when provider registry operations fail during system startup?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
