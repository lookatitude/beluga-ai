## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer building AI applications with the Beluga AI Framework, I need the ChatModels package to provide a global registry for seamless provider management (following the config package pattern) and comprehensive OpenTelemetry integration (following the core package pattern), enabling reliable production deployment and monitoring of chat model operations consistent with the established framework standards.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the config package implements ConfigProviderRegistry with thread-safe operations, **When** implementing chatmodels registry, **Then** the implementation MUST follow the same global registry pattern with RegisterGlobal and NewRegistryProvider functions
2. **Given** the core package implements DI container with OTEL components, **When** integrating observability, **Then** chatmodels MUST use the same metrics, tracing, and logging interfaces as defined in pkg/core/di.go
3. **Given** the config package supports provider metadata and validation, **When** managing chat model providers, **Then** the registry MUST support provider capabilities, health checks, and configuration validation
4. **Given** the core package provides NoOpMetrics for testing, **When** implementing metrics, **Then** chatmodels MUST provide equivalent no-op implementations for development and testing scenarios
5. **Given** the framework uses singleton registry pattern in config, **When** implementing global registry, **Then** chatmodels MUST use the same lazy initialization and global instance pattern

### Edge Cases
- What happens when provider registration conflicts occur, following pkg/config/registry.go error handling?
- How does the system handle OTEL service unavailability, following pkg/core/di.go patterns?
- How are provider metadata and capabilities managed, following config package approach?
- What happens when registry operations timeout, following config creation timeout patterns?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

## Clarifications

### Session 1: Registry Implementation Pattern
**Question**: Should the chatmodels registry follow the exact ConfigProviderRegistry pattern from config package?
**Context**: The config package provides a comprehensive registry implementation with ProviderCreator functions, metadata management, and validation. Need to confirm if chatmodels should use the same pattern or adapt it.
**Options**:
- Exact replication: Use ConfigProviderRegistry pattern directly
- Adapted pattern: Modify for chatmodels-specific needs while maintaining core structure
- Custom implementation: Create new pattern but follow same principles

**Decision Needed**: Confirm registry implementation approach matching reference patterns.

### Session 2: OTEL Integration Scope
**Question**: Should OTEL integration follow the core.di.go Container pattern exactly?
**Context**: Core package provides DI container with OTEL components, metrics collection, and logging interfaces. Need to confirm integration approach.
**Options**:
- Full integration: Use core.di.go Container directly for chatmodels
- Selective integration: Use specific OTEL components from core.di.go
- Extended integration: Build upon core.di.go patterns with chatmodels-specific additions

**Decision Needed**: Define OTEL integration approach following core package reference.

### Session 3: Provider Discovery and Registration
**Question**: How should provider registration work following config package patterns?
**Context**: Config package supports both manual registration and metadata-enhanced registration. Need to define chatmodels provider registration approach.
**Options**:
- Manual registration: Providers call RegisterGlobal explicitly
- Metadata-enhanced: Use RegisterGlobalWithMetadata following config pattern
- Auto-registration: Providers register themselves during package initialization

**Decision Needed**: Choose provider registration mechanism following config reference patterns.

### Session 2025-01-05: Performance Requirements for Registry Operations
- Q: What are the performance requirements for registry operations following core package patterns? ‚Üí A: <1ms registry resolution, <10ms provider creation, <5% OTEL overhead (matching core.di.go performance)
