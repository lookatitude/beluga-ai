# Tasks: Config Package Constitutional Compliance Gaps

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/006-for-the-config/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (✅), research.md (✅), data-model.md (✅), contracts/ (✅)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✅
   → Extract: Go 1.21+, Viper, OpenTelemetry, testify, validator, schema integration
2. Load design documents ✅:
   → data-model.md: ConfigProviderRegistry, ConfigMetrics, ConfigError, ProviderHealthMonitor entities
   → contracts/: registry.go, metrics.go, errors.go
   → research.md: Global registry for multi-provider, OTEL integration, testing infrastructure
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Constitutional file structure preparation
   → Tests: Constitutional testing infrastructure, provider contract tests
   → Core: Registry implementation, OTEL integration, error handling
   → Integration: Health monitoring, provider integration
   → Polish: Performance validation, documentation updates
4. Apply constitutional rules:
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
   → Constitutional files (errors.go, advanced_test.go) priority  
   → Registry pattern → OTEL → Error handling → Testing
   → Preserve existing multi-provider architecture
```

## Dependencies

### Critical Path (Sequential)
- T001-T003 (constitutional structure preparation) before all other tasks
- T004-T015 (constitutional testing infrastructure) before T016-T033 (implementations)
- T016-T020 (registry implementation) before T030-T033 (provider integration)

### Constitutional Requirements
- T004-T005 (advanced_test.go, enhanced test_utils.go) before all other tests
- T016 (registry.go) required for constitutional compliance
- T021-T022 (OTEL RecordOperation, NoOpMetrics) required before advanced features

### Multi-Provider Preservation Dependencies
- T016-T020 (registry implementation) MUST preserve existing provider functionality
- T030-T031 (provider integration) MUST maintain backward compatibility
- T041 (backward compatibility test) blocks final validation

### Testing Dependencies
- T006 (performance benchmarks) depends on T004-T005 (testing infrastructure)
- T007-T015 (contract/integration tests) can run in parallel
- T038-T040 (integration tests) depend on T016-T037 (implementation)

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Phase 3.2 - Constitutional Testing Infrastructure (All Parallel)
```bash
# Launch T004-T011 together (different test files):
Task: "Create advanced_test.go with configuration loading benchmarks"
Task: "Enhance test_utils.go with AdvancedMockConfig and AdvancedMockProvider"
Task: "Contract test for ConfigProviderRegistry interface"
Task: "Contract test for ConfigMetrics interface"  
Task: "Contract test for ConfigError interface"
Task: "Integration test for provider registry operations"
Task: "Integration test for OTEL metrics and health monitoring"
```

### Phase 3.3 - Constitutional Implementation (Mostly Parallel)
```bash
# Launch T016-T025 together (different constitutional features):
Task: "Create registry.go with ConfigProviderRegistry"
Task: "Implement ProviderMetadata structure"
Task: "Enhance metrics.go with RecordOperation method"
Task: "Add NoOpMetrics implementation"
Task: "Create main package errors.go with Op/Err/Code pattern"  
Task: "Define standard error codes for configuration operations"
Task: "Implement distributed tracing for config operations"
Task: "Add structured logging with context propagation"
```

### Phase 3.4-3.5 - Advanced Features & Integration (All Parallel)
```bash
# Launch T034-T043 together (different enhancement areas):
Task: "Implement ProviderHealthMonitor for provider health tracking"
Task: "Add configuration validation health monitoring"
Task: "Create provider performance monitoring utilities"
Task: "Add integration tests with schema package validation"
Task: "Create cross-package compatibility tests"
Task: "Performance regression tests for loading/resolution targets"
Task: "Update README.md with constitutional compliance features"
```

## Performance Targets (From Research)
- **Configuration Loading**: <10ms per configuration load operation
- **Provider Resolution**: <1ms per provider resolution from registry
- **Validation Throughput**: >1000 configurations validated per second
- **Registry Operations**: Thread-safe concurrent access with minimal overhead
- **Health Monitoring**: <5% performance impact on configuration operations

## Constitutional Validation Commands
```bash
# T006 Performance benchmark commands
go test ./pkg/config/... -bench=BenchmarkConfigLoad -benchmem
go test ./pkg/config/... -bench=BenchmarkProviderRegistry -benchmem

# T045 Constitutional compliance verification
go test ./pkg/config/... -v
go test ./tests/integration/... -run="*Config*" -v

# T046 Backward compatibility validation
go test ./pkg/... -run="*Config*" -v  # Test all packages using config
```

## Config Package Specific Notes
- **Critical**: Preserve existing multi-provider functionality (Viper, Composite, custom providers)
- **Performance**: Configuration loading is application startup critical, optimize for speed
- **Testing**: Config testing utilities will be used by other packages for configuration testing
- **Constitutional Compliance**: Config package must exemplify provider registry patterns
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: All configuration loading APIs must remain unchanged
