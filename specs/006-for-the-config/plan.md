# Implementation Plan: Config Package Constitutional Compliance Gaps

**Branch**: `006-for-the-config` | **Date**: October 5, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/006-for-the-config/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code, or `AGENTS.md` for all other agents).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Achieve full constitutional compliance for the Config package by implementing global registry pattern, complete OTEL integration, and constitutional testing infrastructure while preserving excellent existing multi-provider architecture (Viper, Composite providers). The package has strong foundational patterns with comprehensive validation and schema integration, requiring specific compliance enhancements: global registry for provider management, complete OpenTelemetry observability, structured error handling with Op/Err/Code pattern, and advanced testing infrastructure.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Go 1.21+ (existing Beluga AI Framework requirement)
**Primary Dependencies**: Viper (spf13/viper), OpenTelemetry (go.opentelemetry.io/otel), testify (github.com/stretchr/testify), validator (go-playground/validator), schema package integration
**Storage**: Configuration files (YAML, JSON, TOML), environment variables, no persistent storage required
**Testing**: Go test framework with existing test_utils.go, need constitutional advanced_test.go, testify mocks, comprehensive benchmarking
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform Go applications (Linux, macOS, Windows servers and clients)
**Project Type**: Single Go package within larger AI framework (multi-provider package requiring global registry)
**Performance Goals**: Fast config loading (<10ms), efficient provider resolution (<1ms), high-throughput validation (>1000 configs/sec)
**Constraints**: Preserve existing multi-provider functionality, maintain backward compatibility, zero breaking changes to current configuration loading APIs
**Scale/Scope**: Enterprise-grade configuration management supporting multiple providers, complex config hierarchies, framework-wide config coordination

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Package Structure Compliance
- [x] Package follows standard layout (iface/, internal/, providers/, config.go, metrics.go, ✓README.md)
- [ ] Multi-provider packages implement global registry pattern (MISSING - needs registry.go)
- [x] Most required files present (✓test_utils.go, ❌advanced_test.go missing, ✓README.md)
- [ ] Missing main package errors.go (constitutional requirement - currently in iface/errors.go)

### Design Principles Compliance  
- [x] Interfaces follow ISP (Provider, Loader, Validator are focused and well-designed)
- [x] Dependencies injected via constructors (DIP compliance - good factory pattern foundation)
- [x] Single responsibility per package/struct (SRP compliance - focused on configuration management only)
- [x] Functional options used for configuration (composition over inheritance - LoaderOptions pattern implemented)

### Observability & Quality Standards
- [ ] OTEL metrics implementation mandatory (PARTIAL - has metrics.go but missing RecordOperation, NoOpMetrics)
- [ ] Structured error handling with Op/Err/Code pattern (PARTIAL - has good errors in iface/, need main package errors.go)
- [ ] Comprehensive testing requirements (GOOD foundation, missing advanced_test.go for constitutional compliance)
- [x] Integration testing for cross-package interactions (integration_test.go exists)

**Compliance Status**: ✅ STRONG FOUNDATION with **4 key gaps**: Global registry, complete OTEL, main errors.go, advanced_test.go

**Structure Decision**: Existing single Go package structure within the Beluga AI Framework. The Config package has excellent foundational architecture with comprehensive multi-provider support. Primary work involves adding registry.go for global registry pattern, main package errors.go for constitutional compliance, advanced_test.go for testing infrastructure, and enhancing metrics.go with OTEL RecordOperation while preserving the excellent existing multi-provider architecture.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh cursor`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (registry contracts, metrics contracts, error contracts, data model, quickstart examples)
- Each contract interface → interface test task [P]
- Each data model entity → struct creation and validation task [P]
- Each constitutional compliance gap → implementation task with OTEL/registry integration
- Provider registry implementation tasks
- Error handling enhancement tasks
- Advanced testing infrastructure tasks
- Health monitoring integration tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Contract tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Data models → Registry → OTEL → Error handling → Testing → Integration
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent compliance features)
- Constitutional compliance order: Registry → Observability → Error patterns → Testing infrastructure

**Task Categories**:
1. **Registry Implementation**: Global registry pattern with thread-safe provider management (Tasks 1-6)
2. **OTEL Integration**: Complete metrics, tracing, and logging implementation (Tasks 7-12) 
3. **Error Handling**: Constitutional errors.go with Op/Err/Code pattern (Tasks 13-18)
4. **Testing Infrastructure**: Advanced testing utilities and comprehensive benchmarks (Tasks 19-24)
5. **Health Monitoring**: Provider and validation health monitoring integration (Tasks 25-30)

**Estimated Output**: 28-32 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md focused on constitutional compliance gaps

**Key Task Examples**:
- Create ConfigProviderRegistry with thread-safe provider management
- Implement complete OTEL metrics with RecordOperation method
- Create main package errors.go with ConfigError Op/Err/Code pattern
- Add advanced_test.go with comprehensive configuration loading benchmarks
- Enhance provider interfaces with health monitoring capabilities
- Integrate health monitoring with existing OTEL metrics collection

**Config Package Specifics**:
- Preserve all existing multi-provider functionality (Viper, Composite)
- Maintain backward compatibility with current configuration loading APIs
- Build on excellent existing test_utils.go foundation
- Leverage existing schema integration and validation capabilities

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
