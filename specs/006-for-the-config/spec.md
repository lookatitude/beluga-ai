## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using the Beluga AI Framework, I need the Config package to achieve full constitutional compliance while maintaining its current comprehensive configuration management capabilities. The package should provide unified configuration loading across multiple providers (Viper, Composite) with complete observability, proper error handling, and extensible architecture following the global registry pattern for multi-provider packages.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the Config package has good foundational architecture and provider support, **When** analyzing against constitutional requirements, **Then** specific compliance gaps should be identified and addressed
2. **Given** multiple configuration providers need unified management, **When** implementing provider registry pattern, **Then** a global registry should enable seamless provider registration and discovery
3. **Given** observability is critical for configuration operations, **When** using config loading in production, **Then** full OpenTelemetry integration should provide comprehensive metrics, tracing, and health monitoring
4. **Given** error handling consistency is required across the framework, **When** configuration operations fail, **Then** structured error handling with Op/Err/Code pattern should provide actionable error information
5. **Given** the current provider architecture works well, **When** implementing compliance improvements, **Then** existing functionality and multi-provider flexibility must be preserved

### Edge Cases
- What happens when configuration loading fails across all registered providers?
- How does the system handle provider registration conflicts or invalid provider configurations?
- How are constitutional compliance requirements balanced with preserving existing configuration loading behavior?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Global Registry Pattern Implementation
- **FR-001**: System MUST implement the global registry pattern for consistent configuration provider management and discovery
- **FR-002**: System MUST support dynamic provider registration through RegisterGlobal function for extensibility
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide NewProvider function for creating configuration providers from registered factories
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain thread-safe provider registry operations using proper synchronization primitives

#### OTEL Integration Enhancement
- **FR-005**: System MUST implement complete OTEL metrics collection with RecordOperation method for all configuration operations
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide NoOpMetrics function for testing and development scenarios
- **FR-007**: System MUST support distributed tracing capabilities with proper span management for configuration loading
- **FR-008**: System MUST include structured logging with context propagation across configuration operations

#### Error Handling Constitutional Compliance
- **FR-009**: System MUST implement comprehensive Op/Err/Code error pattern for all configuration operations
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide main package errors.go file following constitutional structure
- **FR-011**: System MUST define standard error codes as constants for programmatic error handling
- **FR-012**: System MUST preserve error chains through Unwrap() method for proper error tracing
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide context-aware error messages with operation details for debugging

#### Advanced Testing Infrastructure
- **FR-014**: System MUST implement advanced_test.go with comprehensive test suites and performance benchmarks
- **FR-015**: System MUST enhance existing test_utils.go with AdvancedMockConfig and AdvancedMockProvider utilities
- **FR-016**: System MUST provide table-driven tests, concurrency testing, and error handling scenarios
- **FR-017**: System MUST include performance benchmarks for configuration loading, validation, and provider operations

#### Provider Architecture Enhancement  
- **FR-018**: System MUST implement factory.go or registry.go for centralized provider management
- **FR-019**: System MUST support provider discovery and enumeration through registry methods
- **FR-020**: System MUST enable provider-specific configuration while maintaining unified interface
- **FR-021**: System MUST validate provider configurations with detailed error messages

#### Configuration Management Preservation
- **FR-022**: System MUST preserve existing multi-format support (YAML, JSON, TOML)
- **FR-023**: System MUST maintain current environment variable override capabilities  
- **FR-024**: System MUST preserve composite provider functionality with fallback logic
- **FR-025**: System MUST maintain schema-based validation integration
- **FR-026**: System MUST preserve existing loader options and factory functions

#### Health Monitoring Integration
- **FR-027**: System MUST implement health checking capabilities for configuration providers
- **FR-028**: System MUST provide configuration validation health monitoring
- **FR-029**: System MUST support configuration reload health validation
