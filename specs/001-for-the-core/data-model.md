# Data Model: Core Package Constitutional Compliance Enhancement

## Core Entities

### Runnable Interface
**Purpose**: Central abstraction for executable AI components that enables unified orchestration  
**Attributes**:
- Invoke method for synchronous execution
- Batch method for concurrent/batch processing  
- Stream method for streaming/real-time processing
- Context support for cancellation and request-scoped values
- Options support for flexible configuration

**Relationships**: Implemented by LLMs, retrievers, agents, chains, graphs, and all orchestrable components

**Validation Rules**:
- All methods MUST handle context cancellation
- All methods MUST support functional options
- Implementation MUST be thread-safe
- Errors MUST follow structured error patterns

### Container (Dependency Injection)
**Purpose**: Type-safe dependency registration, resolution, and lifecycle management  
**Attributes**:
- Factory function registry with type mapping
- Singleton instance management
- Recursive dependency resolution
- Health checking capabilities
- Observability integration (tracing, logging)

**Relationships**: Used by all packages for dependency management, integrates with monitoring systems

**Validation Rules**:
- Factory functions MUST return concrete types or interfaces
- Circular dependency detection MUST prevent infinite resolution loops
- Health checks MUST validate component availability
- All operations MUST be thread-safe

### Option Interface  
**Purpose**: Flexible configuration pattern for all framework components
**Attributes**:
- Apply method for configuration modification
- Type-safe configuration map manipulation
- Functional composition support

**Relationships**: Used by all Runnable implementations and framework configuration

**Validation Rules**:
- Implementations MUST be idempotent
- Configuration modifications MUST be atomic
- Options MUST compose without conflicts

### HealthChecker Interface
**Purpose**: Standardized health monitoring for component reliability
**Attributes**:
- CheckHealth method with context support
- Error return for unhealthy status
- Integration with observability systems

**Relationships**: Implemented by all critical framework components

**Validation Rules**:
- Health checks MUST be lightweight and fast
- Health status MUST reflect actual component capability
- Context cancellation MUST be respected

### Metrics (OTEL Integration)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive observability for all core operations
**Attributes**:
- OTEL meter and tracer integration
- Standardized metric collection (counters, histograms)
- Distributed tracing support
- Performance monitoring

**Relationships**: Used by all framework components for observability

**Validation Rules**:
- MUST follow constitutional OTEL patterns
- Metric names MUST follow framework conventions
- Performance impact MUST be negligible
- NoOp implementation MUST be available for testing

### FrameworkError (Structured Errors)
**Purpose**: Consistent error handling with operation context and error codes
**Attributes**:
- Operation name (Op) for context
- Underlying error (Err) for error chaining
- Error code (Code) for programmatic handling
- Error type enumeration for categorization

**Relationships**: Used by all framework packages for consistent error reporting

**Validation Rules**:
- MUST preserve error chains through Unwrap()
- Error codes MUST be consistent across framework
- Operation context MUST provide meaningful debugging information
- Error types MUST enable programmatic error handling

### Logger/TracerProvider Abstractions
**Purpose**: Monitoring abstractions for structured logging and distributed tracing
**Attributes**:
- Structured logging with key-value pairs
- Tracing with span creation and management
- Integration with OTEL providers
- NoOp implementations for testing

**Relationships**: Used by DI container and other core components

**Validation Rules**:
- MUST integrate with OTEL standards
- Log levels MUST be appropriate for context
- Tracing MUST not impact performance significantly
- Testing implementations MUST be available

## State Transitions

### DI Container Lifecycle
1. **Created** → Register factory functions and singletons
2. **Registering** → Build dependency graph and validate
3. **Resolving** → Recursive resolution with circular detection
4. **Healthy** → All dependencies resolved and functional
5. **Unhealthy** → Failed resolution or component failure

### Component Health States
1. **Unknown** → Initial state before first check
2. **Healthy** → All health checks passing
3. **Degraded** → Some functionality impaired but operational
4. **Unhealthy** → Critical failure, component non-functional
5. **Recovering** → Transitioning from unhealthy to healthy

### Configuration Lifecycle
1. **Uninitialized** → Default configuration state
2. **Loading** → Applying functional options
3. **Validated** → Configuration validation passed
4. **Active** → Configuration in use by components
5. **Modified** → Configuration updated with new options
