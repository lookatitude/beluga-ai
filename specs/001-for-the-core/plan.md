# Implementation Plan: Core Package Constitutional Compliance Enhancement

**Branch**: `001-for-the-core` | **Date**: 2025-01-05 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/home/swift/Projects/lookatitude/beluga-ai/specs/001-for-the-core/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   â†’ If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   â†’ Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   â†’ Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   â†’ If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   â†’ If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   â†’ Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 â†’ research.md
   â†’ If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 â†’ contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code, or `AGENTS.md` for all other agents).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   â†’ If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   â†’ Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 â†’ Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Enhance the core package to achieve 100% constitutional compliance while preserving all existing functionality (dependency injection, Runnable interface, utilities, models). Add missing constitutional files (config.go, test_utils.go, advanced_test.go), ensure proper package structure with iface/ directory, and implement comprehensive testing infrastructure. Technical approach: incremental enhancement with backward compatibility, OTEL observability integration, and advanced testing utilities following established framework patterns.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Go 1.21+  
**Primary Dependencies**: OpenTelemetry (go.opentelemetry.io/otel), testify (github.com/stretchr/testify), validator (github.com/go-playground/validator)  
**Storage**: N/A (foundational package)  
**Testing**: Go test framework with testify, table-driven tests, benchmarks, integration tests  
**Target Platform**: Multi-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows) - foundational library package
**Project Type**: single - Go package library enhancement  
**Performance Goals**: <1ms DI resolution, <100Âµs Runnable invoke overhead, 10,000+ ops/sec throughput  
**Constraints**: Zero breaking changes, preserve all existing APIs, maintain thread safety, negligible memory overhead  
**Scale/Scope**: Foundation for 14 framework packages, supports complex AI workflows with thousands of components

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Package Structure Compliance
- [x] Package has metrics.go âœ… (already implemented with OTEL)
- [x] Package has errors.go âœ… (FrameworkError types implemented)
- [x] Package has interfaces.go âœ… (Runnable, Retriever, HealthChecker)
- [x] Package has README.md âœ… (comprehensive documentation)
- [ ] Package missing iface/ directory (need to create and move interfaces)
- [ ] Package missing config.go (need constitutional configuration management)
- [ ] Package missing test_utils.go (need advanced testing utilities)
- [ ] Package missing advanced_test.go (need comprehensive test suites)

```

**Structure Decision**: Enhance existing Go package structure to achieve constitutional compliance while preserving all current functionality. Move interfaces to iface/ directory, add missing constitutional files, and upgrade testing infrastructure to enterprise-grade standards. All changes maintain backward compatibility.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION â†’ research task
   - For each dependency â†’ best practices task
   - For each integration â†’ patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** â†’ `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action â†’ endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story â†’ integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh cursor`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy for Core Package**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base with constitutional compliance additions
- **Constitutional Structure Tasks**: Create iface/ directory, config.go, test_utils.go, advanced_test.go
- **Interface Migration Tasks**: Move interfaces to iface/ with backward compatibility re-exports
- **Testing Enhancement Tasks**: Upgrade existing tests to constitutional standards
- **Integration Tasks**: Add cross-package integration tests to tests/integration/
- **Performance Tasks**: Add comprehensive benchmarks for all critical operations
- **Documentation Tasks**: Update README.md and add package documentation

**Core Package Specific Ordering**:
- **Phase 1**: Constitutional structure (iface/, config.go, test_utils.go, advanced_test.go) [P]
- **Phase 2**: Interface migration with re-exports for compatibility [Sequential]
- **Phase 3**: Advanced testing infrastructure implementation [P]  
- **Phase 4**: Integration testing and performance benchmarks [P]
- **Phase 5**: Documentation updates and final validation

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md focusing on constitutional compliance

**Core Package Specifics**:
- Preserve ALL existing functionality and APIs
- Maintain backward compatibility through re-exports
- Focus on additive changes rather than modifications
- Prioritize testing infrastructure for framework foundation role

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS (4 gaps identified, no violations)
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS (no new violations introduced)
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved (none present)
- [x] Complexity deviations documented (none present)
