# Feature Specification: Core Package Constitutional Compliance Enhancement

**Feature Branch**: `001-for-the-core`  
**Created**: 2025-01-05  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "For the 'core' package in Beluga AI Framework: Analyze current implementation (foundational utilities, dependency injection container, core model definitions) from attached README.md. Identify gaps in standards from package_design_patterns.md (e.g., OTEL metrics, registry if multi-provider, testing suites). Specify desired state: Fully adhere to all patterns (structure, interfaces, config, errors, metrics, testing). Preserve all functionalities (utils, DI, models), flexibility (extensible), and ease of use (simple APIs). Include user stories for core usage in AI workflows."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a Beluga AI Framework developer, I need the core package to provide foundational utilities, dependency injection, and interfaces that all other packages can reliably depend on, while maintaining full constitutional compliance and enterprise-grade testing standards.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new AI component is being developed, **When** the developer needs foundational interfaces and DI container, **Then** the core package provides clean, well-documented abstractions that follow ISP and DIP principles
2. **Given** multiple AI packages need observability, **When** they depend on core package, **Then** standardized OTEL metrics, tracing, and error handling are consistently available
3. **Given** a developer is testing AI workflows, **When** they need to mock core components, **Then** comprehensive testing utilities and advanced mocks are available following the constitutional testing standards
4. **Given** an AI application needs dependency injection, **When** components are registered and resolved, **Then** the DI container provides type-safe resolution with full observability and health checking
5. **Given** AI components need to be chained together, **When** developers use the Runnable interface, **Then** uniform execution patterns work across all component types (LLMs, retrievers, agents, etc.)

### Edge Cases
- What happens when DI container fails to resolve dependencies due to circular references?
- How does system handle when core components become unhealthy during AI workflow execution?
- What happens when Runnable components fail during batch or streaming operations?
- How does the system handle when required constitutional compliance files are missing from dependent packages?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Constitutional Compliance
- **FR-001**: Core package MUST follow the exact constitutional package structure with iface/, config.go, metrics.go, errors.go, test_utils.go, and advanced_test.go
- **FR-002**: Core package MUST maintain all existing functionality (DI container, Runnable interface, utilities, models) while achieving full compliance
- **FR-003**: Core package MUST provide configuration management through config.go with validation and functional options
- **FR-004**: Core package MUST implement comprehensive testing infrastructure with advanced mocks, table-driven tests, concurrency testing, and performance benchmarks

#### Foundational Services  
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide dependency injection container with type-safe registration and resolution
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide Runnable interface that enables uniform execution patterns across all AI components
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide standardized error handling with operation context, error codes, and error chaining
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide OTEL observability integration for metrics collection, distributed tracing, and structured logging
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide health checking capabilities for monitoring component status

#### Developer Experience
- **FR-010**: Core interfaces MUST be simple to use and understand for AI workflow development
- **FR-011**: Dependency injection MUST support both factory functions and singleton instances with minimal configuration
- **FR-012**: Error handling MUST provide clear operation context and programmatic error identification
- **FR-013**: Runnable components MUST support synchronous (Invoke), batch (Batch), and streaming (Stream) execution modes
- **FR-014**: Core utilities MUST provide foundational functions that other packages commonly need

#### Extensibility & Integration
- **FR-015**: Core package MUST enable other packages to easily implement standardized interfaces
- **FR-016**: DI container MUST support recursive dependency resolution with circular reference detection
- **FR-017**: Observability components MUST integrate seamlessly with external OTEL collectors and monitoring systems
- **FR-018**: Core package MUST provide testing utilities that enable other packages to achieve constitutional compliance
- **FR-019**: All core interfaces MUST follow interface segregation principle with focused, single-purpose contracts

#### Performance & Reliability
- **FR-020**: DI container MUST perform type resolution efficiently with minimal reflection overhead
- **FR-021**: Runnable interface implementations MUST support concurrent execution without data races
- **FR-022**: Metrics collection MUST have negligible performance impact on AI component operations
- **FR-023**: Core package MUST provide benchmarking utilities for performance validation across the framework

### Key Entities

- **Runnable**: Core executable component interface that unifies LLMs, retrievers, agents, chains, and other AI components for consistent orchestration
- **Container**: Dependency injection container that manages type registration, resolution, and lifecycle with built-in observability
- **Option**: Configuration interface that enables functional options pattern for flexible component configuration
- **HealthChecker**: Health monitoring interface that provides status checking for component reliability
- **Metrics**: OTEL metrics collection for observability across all framework operations
- **FrameworkError**: Standardized error type with operation context, error codes, and error chaining
- **Logger/TracerProvider**: Monitoring abstractions for structured logging and distributed tracing
