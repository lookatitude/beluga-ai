# Tasks: Core Package Constitutional Compliance Enhancement

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-for-the-core/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (✅), research.md (✅), data-model.md (✅), contracts/ (✅)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✅
   → Extract: Go 1.21+, OpenTelemetry, testify, validator
2. Load design documents ✅:
   → data-model.md: Runnable Interface, Container (DI), Option Interface entities
   → contracts/: container_interface.md, runnable_interface.md
   → research.md: Backward compatibility strategy, advanced testing infrastructure
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Package structure reorganization with backward compatibility
   → Tests: Constitutional testing files, contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: Missing constitutional files (config.go, test_utils.go, advanced_test.go)
   → Integration: OTEL validation, DI container enhancement, health checks
   → Polish: Performance benchmarks, documentation updates
4. Apply constitutional rules:
   → Structure before tests (backward compatibility critical)
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
   → Constitutional files mandatory
   → Zero breaking changes throughout
```

## Dependencies

### Critical Path (Sequential)
- T001-T005 (package structure) before all other tasks
- T006-T015 (constitutional testing) before T016-T033 (implementations)
- T025 (OTEL validation) before T026-T029 (observability enhancements)

### Constitutional Requirements
- T006-T007 (test_utils.go, advanced_test.go) before all other tests
- T016 (config.go) required for constitutional compliance
- T025 (OTEL metrics) required before advanced features

### Backward Compatibility Dependencies
- T001-T005 (interface reorganization) MUST maintain existing imports
- T037 (backward compatibility test) blocks final validation
- T042 (compatibility validation) required for completion

### Testing Dependencies
- T008 (performance benchmarks) depends on T006-T007 (testing infrastructure)
- T009-T015 (contract/integration tests) can run in parallel
- T034-T036 (integration tests) depend on T016-T033 (implementation)

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Phase 3.1 - Structure Setup (Mostly Sequential for Compatibility)
```bash
# T002-T004 can run together (different interface files):
Task: "Move Runnable interface to iface/runnable.go with backward compatibility"
Task: "Move HealthChecker interface to iface/health.go with backward compatibility"  
Task: "Move Option interface to iface/option.go with backward compatibility"
```

### Phase 3.2 - Constitutional Testing (All Parallel)
```bash
# Launch T006-T012 together (different test files):
Task: "Create test_utils.go with AdvancedMockRunnable and AdvancedMockContainer"
Task: "Create advanced_test.go with table-driven tests and benchmarks"
Task: "Contract test for Container interface"
Task: "Contract test for Runnable interface"
Task: "Integration test for Container-Runnable interaction"
Task: "Integration test for OTEL metrics and health monitoring"
```

### Phase 3.3 - Constitutional Implementation (All Parallel)
```bash
# Launch T016-T021 together (different files):
Task: "Create config.go with CoreConfig and functional options"
Task: "Enhance errors.go for full Op/Err/Code compliance"
Task: "Validate metrics.go OTEL integration"
Task: "Enhance Container interface implementation with health checking"
Task: "Enhance Runnable interface implementation with monitoring"
Task: "Add Option interface enhancements for type safety"
```

### Phase 3.5-3.6 - Advanced Features (All Parallel)
```bash
# Launch T030-T036 together (different enhancement areas):
Task: "Add advanced DI container features"
Task: "Add Runnable composition utilities"
Task: "Implement performance monitoring wrapper"  
Task: "Add memory optimization for high-frequency operations"
Task: "Add integration tests with other framework packages"
Task: "Create cross-package compatibility tests"
```

## Performance Targets (From Research)
- **DI Resolution**: <1ms per resolution operation
- **Runnable Invoke**: <100μs overhead per operation  
- **Container Operations**: 10,000+ ops/sec throughput
- **Memory Usage**: Negligible overhead for foundational operations
- **Concurrent Operations**: Linear scaling with thread safety

## Constitutional Validation Commands
```bash
# T008 Performance benchmark commands
go test ./pkg/core/... -bench=BenchmarkContainer -benchmem
go test ./pkg/core/... -bench=BenchmarkRunnable -benchmem

# T041 Constitutional compliance verification
go test ./pkg/core/... -v
go test ./tests/integration/... -run="*Core*" -v

# T042 Backward compatibility validation  
go test ./pkg/... -run="*Core*" -v  # Test all packages using core
```

## Core Package Specific Notes
- **Critical**: Maintain backward compatibility - core is used by all 14 framework packages
- **Performance**: Core operations are called frequently, optimization critical
- **Testing**: Core testing utilities will be used by all other packages
- **Constitutional Compliance**: Core package must exemplify all framework patterns
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Any API changes must be additive only
