# Tasks: LLMs Package Framework Compliance Analysis

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-for-the-llms/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (✅), research.md (✅), data-model.md (✅), contracts/ (✅), quickstart.md (✅)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✅
   → Extract: Go 1.21+, OpenTelemetry, testify/mock, provider SDKs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Bedrock, Ollama)
2. Load design documents ✅:
   → data-model.md: BenchmarkResult, TokenUsage, LatencyMetrics, PerformanceProfile, MockConfiguration entities
   → contracts/: benchmark_runner.go, benchmark_results.go with comprehensive interfaces
   → research.md: Enhanced benchmark patterns, profiling integration, cross-provider framework
   → quickstart.md: Benchmark usage scenarios and performance analysis examples
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Verification: Constitutional compliance validation, existing functionality preservation
   → Enhancement: Advanced benchmark infrastructure, performance profiling, provider comparison
   → Testing: Enhanced test coverage, advanced mock configurations, load testing
   → Integration: Cross-provider benchmarking, trend analysis, optimization tools
   → Polish: Documentation updates, example enhancements
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Verification before enhancement (validation approach)
   → Constitutional compliance maintained throughout
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001-T040)
6. Dependencies: Verification → Enhancement → Testing → Integration → Polish
```

## LLMs Package Specific Notes
- **Critical**: LLMs package is already highly compliant - focus on verification and enhancement, not correction
- **Performance**: Benchmark infrastructure should not impact existing LLM operation performance
- **Testing**: Enhanced benchmark testing will be used for provider selection and optimization decisions
- **Constitutional Compliance**: Package already exemplifies all framework patterns
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: All benchmark enhancements must be additive only
- **Provider Agnostic**: All benchmarks must work uniformly across OpenAI, Anthropic, Bedrock, Ollama
