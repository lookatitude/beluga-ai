# Implementation Plan: LLMs Package Framework Compliance Analysis

**Branch**: `004-for-the-llms` | **Date**: October 5, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/004-for-the-llms/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code, or `AGENTS.md` for all other agents).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Enhance the already highly compliant LLMs package with focus on performance benchmarking capabilities. The package demonstrates exemplary framework compliance with unified ChatModel/LLM interfaces, multi-provider support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Bedrock, Ollama), comprehensive testing, and OTEL observability. Primary need is to strengthen benchmark testing infrastructure for performance optimization and provider comparison, while preserving the existing multi-provider flexibility and framework patterns.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Go 1.21+ (existing Beluga AI Framework requirement)
**Primary Dependencies**: OpenTelemetry, testify/mock, providers (OpenAI SDK, Anthropic SDK, AWS Bedrock SDK, Ollama client)
**Storage**: N/A (LLM provider APIs - no persistent storage required)
**Testing**: Go test framework with advanced mocking, table-driven tests, benchmarking, concurrency testing  
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform Go applications (Linux/macOS/Windows servers)
**Project Type**: Single Go package within larger AI framework
**Performance Goals**: Enhanced benchmark coverage for provider comparison, latency analysis, throughput measurement, token usage tracking
**Constraints**: Preserve existing interfaces, maintain backward compatibility, follow framework patterns  
**Scale/Scope**: Enterprise-grade LLM abstraction supporting multiple concurrent providers with comprehensive observability

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Package Structure Compliance
- [x] Package follows standard layout (iface/, internal/, providers/, config.go, metrics.go, errors.go, etc.)
- [x] Multi-provider packages implement global registry pattern
- [x] All required files present (test_utils.go, advanced_test.go, README.md)

### Design Principles Compliance  
- [x] Interfaces follow ISP (ChatModel, LLM, MessageGenerator focused interfaces)
- [x] Dependencies injected via constructors (DIP compliance via factory pattern)
- [x] Single responsibility per package/struct (LLM interactions only)
- [x] Functional options used for configuration (WithProvider, WithAPIKey, etc.)

### Observability & Quality Standards
- [x] OTEL metrics implementation mandatory (comprehensive metrics.go)
- [x] Structured error handling with Op/Err/Code pattern (LLMError implementation)
- [x] Comprehensive testing requirements (AdvancedMockChatModel, table-driven tests, benchmarks)
- [x] Integration testing for cross-package interactions (provider interface tests)

**Compliance Status**: ✅ FULL COMPLIANCE - Package exemplifies framework patterns. Only enhancement needed is expanded benchmark coverage.

**Structure Decision**: Existing single Go package structure within the Beluga AI Framework. Focus on enhancing benchmark testing capabilities within the current well-established architecture.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh cursor`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (benchmark contracts, data model, quickstart examples)
- Each benchmark interface → interface test task [P]
- Each data model entity → struct creation and validation task [P]
- Each quickstart example → example implementation task [P] 
- Benchmark infrastructure implementation tasks
- Enhanced mock provider implementation tasks
- Integration tasks with existing LLMs package components

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Benchmark tests before implementation
- Infrastructure order: Data models → Interfaces → Implementations → Integration
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent components)
- Dependency order: Core benchmarking → Provider-specific enhancements → Analysis tools

**Task Categories**:
1. **Core Infrastructure**: Data models, interfaces, validation (Tasks 1-8)
2. **Benchmark Implementation**: Runner, analyzer, profiler (Tasks 9-16) 
3. **Provider Enhancements**: Mock improvements, integration (Tasks 17-22)
4. **Testing & Documentation**: Comprehensive tests, examples, docs (Tasks 23-28)

**Estimated Output**: 26-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md focused on benchmarking enhancements

**Key Task Examples**:
- Create BenchmarkResult data structures with validation
- Implement BenchmarkRunner interface with OTEL metrics
- Enhance MockProvider with realistic performance simulation  
- Add comprehensive benchmark test suites
- Create provider comparison analysis tools
- Update existing tests to include benchmark validation

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented (none required)
