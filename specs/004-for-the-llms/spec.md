**Created**: October 5, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "For the 'llms' package: Analyze current (LLM interface, providers like OpenAI/Anthropic, factory, comprehensive testing) from README.md. Minimal gaps as it's compliant; specify any minor corrections. Preserve multi-provider flexibility."

## Execution Flow (main)
```

   ‚Üí Data: current implementation, framework patterns
   ‚Üí Constraints: preserve multi-provider flexibility, minimal changes needed
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All aspects clear from comprehensive README analysis
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow: maintain compliant, extensible LLM framework
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement focused on preserving/enhancing existing compliance
6. Identify Key Entities: Interfaces, Providers, Factory, Configuration, Testing
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ No uncertainties - package is highly compliant
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ No implementation details - focused on functional requirements
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer building AI applications with the Beluga AI Framework, I need the LLMs package to maintain its current high level of framework compliance while ensuring seamless extensibility for new LLM providers and advanced features. The package should continue providing unified interfaces across multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Bedrock, Ollama) with comprehensive testing, observability, and configuration management.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the LLMs package is already highly compliant with framework patterns, **When** conducting compliance analysis, **Then** minimal gaps should be identified with focus on enhancement opportunities
2. **Given** multiple LLM providers are supported, **When** adding new providers, **Then** the multi-provider flexibility must be preserved through consistent factory patterns
3. **Given** comprehensive testing infrastructure exists, **When** evaluating test coverage, **Then** testing patterns should align with enterprise-grade standards across unit, integration, and performance testing
4. **Given** OTEL observability is implemented, **When** using LLMs in production, **Then** tracing, metrics, and logging should provide complete operational visibility
5. **Given** streaming and tool calling are supported, **When** using advanced features, **Then** functionality should work consistently across all providers

### Edge Cases
- What happens when new providers need different configuration patterns while maintaining unified interfaces?
- How does the system handle provider-specific advanced features (like multi-modal) without breaking the unified interface?
- How are framework pattern compliance and backward compatibility maintained during enhancements?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Interface Compliance
- **FR-001**: System MUST maintain the current ISP-compliant interface design with focused ChatModel and LLM interfaces
- **FR-002**: System MUST preserve the existing multi-provider architecture supporting OpenAI, Anthropic, Bedrock, Ollama, and Mock providers
- **FR-003**: System MUST continue supporting unified streaming responses with AIMessageChunk across all providers
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain cross-provider tool calling capabilities with consistent binding patterns

#### Factory and Extensibility
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve the current factory pattern for provider registration and instantiation
- **FR-006**: System MUST support dynamic provider registration through RegisterProviderFactory methods
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain configuration flexibility through functional options pattern
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow seamless addition of new providers without breaking existing implementations

#### Testing Infrastructure
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain comprehensive testing utilities including AdvancedMockChatModel for unit testing
- **FR-010**: System MUST continue providing interface compliance testing through ProviderInterfaceTestSuite
- **FR-011**: System MUST support table-driven testing patterns with advanced test scenarios
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide integration testing capabilities with real provider testing infrastructure
- **FR-013**: System MUST include performance benchmarking and concurrency testing capabilities

#### Observability and Monitoring  
- **FR-014**: System MUST maintain OpenTelemetry integration with tracing, metrics, and structured logging
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide health checking capabilities for all provider implementations
- **FR-016**: System MUST support metrics collection for request count, duration, error rates, and token usage
- **FR-017**: System MUST enable distributed tracing across LLM operations with proper span management

#### Error Handling and Configuration
- **FR-018**: System MUST maintain custom error types following the Op/Err/Code pattern for comprehensive error handling
- **FR-019**: System MUST provide retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
- **FR-020**: System MUST support configuration validation with detailed error messages for missing or invalid settings
- **FR-021**: System MUST maintain provider-specific configuration options while preserving unified configuration patterns

#### Advanced Features (Enhancement Opportunities)
- **FR-022**: System SHOULD enhance multi-modal support for image and file processing capabilities across providers
- **FR-023**: System SHOULD provide response caching mechanisms with intelligent invalidation strategies
- **FR-024**: System SHOULD implement cost tracking and token usage optimization features
- **FR-025**: System SHOULD support intelligent model routing based on request complexity and provider capabilities
- **FR-026**: System SHOULD provide advanced rate limiting with token bucket algorithms for production deployment

### Key Entities

- **ChatModel Interface**: Core abstraction providing unified access to chat-based language models with generate, stream, and tool binding capabilities
