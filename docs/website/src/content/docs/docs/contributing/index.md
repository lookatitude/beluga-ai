Thank you for your interest in contributing to Beluga AI! Beluga is a large framework — 157 packages and 100+ providers — built by a community that values code quality, consistent patterns, and thorough testing. Every contribution helps make the framework better for Go developers building production AI systems. Whether you're fixing a typo, reporting a bug, or implementing a new feature, your help is valued and appreciated.

## Ways to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to Beluga AI, and not all of them involve writing code. The framework benefits as much from clear documentation, well-reported bugs, and community support as it does from code changes:

- **Feature Requests** — Have an idea for a new feature or improvement? Start a discussion or open an issue to share your thoughts.
- **Documentation Improvements** — Spotted a typo, unclear explanation, or missing guide? Documentation PRs are always welcome.
- **Code Contributions** — Fix bugs, implement features, add providers, or improve performance. See the [Development Setup](/docs/contributing/development-setup/) to get started.
- **Answering Questions** — Help other users in GitHub Discussions by sharing your experience and knowledge.
