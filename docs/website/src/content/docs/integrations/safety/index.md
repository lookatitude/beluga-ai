Deploying AI in production requires demonstrable safety controls. Regulators, enterprise customers, and internal compliance teams need evidence that your system filters harmful content, protects sensitive data, and maintains an audit trail of safety decisions. These guides cover integrating external content safety APIs into the guard pipeline and exporting guard results as structured JSON for auditing and compliance reporting.

|-------|-------------|
| [Safety Result JSON Reporting](./safety-json-reporting/) | Export guard pipeline results as structured JSON for auditing |
| [Third-Party Ethical API Filter](./ethical-api-filter/) | Integrate external content safety APIs with the guard pipeline |
