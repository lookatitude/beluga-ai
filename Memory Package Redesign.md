Memory Package Redesign
Memory has good iface/ but lacks metrics and full config integration.
Add config.go for all memory types (e.g., BufferConfig embeds base Config).
Add metrics for memory operations (e.g., load_duration_seconds).
Integrate with monitoring for tracing saves/loads.
Add error codes (e.g., ErrMemoryOverflow).
Make histories composable (e.g., chain multiple histories).
Update providers (e.g., base_history) with factories.
Add tests for configs and metrics.
Document memory types and extensions in README.md.
do not change implementation just yet create a todo.md file in the package detailing all the changes necessary.
Package needs to be consistent, easy to use and configure and be extensible.


Monitoring Package Redesign
Monitoring is advanced but needs better integration with other packages.
Ensure all packages use monitoring (e.g., via DIP injection).
Add config validation for monitoring setups.
Enhance metrics for framework-wide events (e.g., using OTEL).
Integrate safety/ethics with server for exposure.
Add error handling for monitoring failures.
Update tests for cross-package monitoring.
Document as observability hub in README.md.
do not change implementation just yet create a todo.md file in the package detailing all the changes necessary.
Package needs to be consistent, easy to use and configure and be extensible.


Orchestration Package Redesign
Orchestration is incomplete (many "path_only" files); needs full implementation aligned with goals.
Implement Chain/Graph/Workflow interfaces with factories.
Add config.go for orchestration types.
Integrate with monitoring for tracing workflows.
Add metrics for executions (e.g., workflow_duration_seconds).
Use schema for input/output formats.
Implement messagebus and scheduler as per outlines.
Add error codes (e.g., ErrWorkflowDeadlock).
Ensure composition with agents/llms (e.g., agents as workflow steps).
Add tests for end-to-end orchestration.
Document patterns (chains vs graphs vs workflows) in README.md.
do not change implementation just yet create a todo.md file in the package detailing all the changes necessary.

Prompts Package Redesign
Prompts lacks config and metrics; needs better templating.
Add config.go for prompt templates (e.g., load from files).
Add factories for prompt creation.
Integrate with schema for message formats.
Add metrics for prompt generations.
Add tracing for template rendering.
Enhance errors for template failures.
Update tests for configs.
Document in README.md with examples.
do not change implementation just yet create a todo.md file in the package detailing all the changes necessary.
Package needs to be consistent, easy to use and configure and be extensible.


Retrievers Package Redesign
Retrievers is basic; needs alignment with vectorstores.
Add config.go for retriever types.
Implement factories (e.g., NewRetriever).
Add metrics for retrievals (e.g., retrieval_duration_seconds).
Integrate with monitoring.
Add error codes (e.g., ErrNoDocumentsFound).
Ensure composition with embeddings/vectorstores.
Update tests.
Document in README.md.
do not change implementation just yet create a todo.md file in the package detailing all the changes necessary.
Package needs to be consistent, easy to use and configure and be extensible.


Schema Package Redesign
Schema is central for data formats; needs expansion.
Add config for schema validation.
Define more types (e.g., for A2A, events).
Add metrics for schema operations.
Integrate with all packages for consistent data.
Add error codes for validation failures.
Update tests.
Document as data contract layer in README.md.
do not change implementation just yet create a todo.md file in the package detailing all the changes necessary.
Package needs to be consistent, easy to use and configure and be extensible.


Server Package Redesign
Server needs to expose all components (e.g., agents, workflows).
Add config.go for server types (MCP, REST).
Implement factories for servers.
Integrate with monitoring for API metrics.
Use schema for request/response formats.
Add streaming support for REST.
Enhance errors for API failures.
Add tests for integrations.
Document endpoints in README.md.

Package needs to be consistent, easy to use and configure and be extensible.


Vectorstores Package Redesign
Vectorstores has good iface/ but inconsistent providers.
Add central factory for stores.
Ensure config validation for all providers.
Add metrics for add/retrieve operations.
Integrate with embeddings and retrievers.
Add error codes (e.g., ErrIndexNotFound).
Update tests.
Document providers in README.md.
do not change implementation just yet create a todo.md file in the package detailing all the changes necessary.

Cross-Package Integrations and Global Steps
Standardize all packages to have iface/, config.go, metrics.go, errors.go, tests with mocks.
Ensure all use core.Runnable for orchestration compatibility.
Integrate all with config package for dynamic loading.
Add framework-wide monitoring (e.g., via monitoring package injection).
Create A2A protocols using schema (e.g., for agents/orchestration).
Expose components via server (e.g., agents as APIs, workflows as endpoints).
Add UI package integration for monitoring dashboards.
Run integration tests to validate redesigns.
Update all README.md with examples and design patterns.
