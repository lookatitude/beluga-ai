# Beluga-ai

**🚀 PRODUCTION READY: Beluga-ai has completed comprehensive standardization and is now enterprise-grade with consistent patterns, extensive testing, and production-ready observability across all 14 packages. The framework is ready for large-scale deployment and development teams.**

**Beluga-ai** is a comprehensive framework written in Go, designed for building sophisticated AI and agentic applications. Inspired by frameworks like [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) and [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/), Beluga-ai provides a robust set of tools and abstractions to streamline the development of applications leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs).

This framework has recently undergone a significant refactoring to improve modularity, extendibility, and maintainability, adhering to Go best practices. For a detailed explanation of the new architecture, please see [Beluga_Refactored_Architecture.md](./Beluga_Refactored_Architecture.md).

## Overview

The goal of Beluga-ai is to offer a Go-native alternative for creating complex AI workflows. The recent refactoring has focused on establishing a clear, layered architecture with well-defined interfaces to support:

*   **Extensible LLM Integration:** Seamlessly connect to various LLM providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini) with a unified interface and provider-specific adapters.
*   **Agent Creation:** Build autonomous agents capable of reasoning, planning, and executing tasks using a modular agent framework.
*   **Extensible Tool Management:** Define, integrate, and manage diverse tools (e.g., Shell, Go Functions, API callers) for agents to use through a common interface.
*   **Extensible Memory Management:** Equip agents with different types of memory, supporting various backends, including multiple vector database providers (e.g., InMemory, pgvector, Pinecone, Weaviate).
*   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Implement RAG pipelines with swappable components for data loading, splitting, embedding, and retrieval.
*   **Extensible Orchestration:** Define and manage complex workflows with a flexible engine, potentially integrating with external orchestrators.
*   **Communication:** Establish protocols for inter-agent communication (future).

## Core Principle: Extensibility via Provider Interfaces

Beluga-ai is built with extensibility at its core. Key components are designed around Go interfaces, allowing developers to easily implement and integrate their own providers or third-party services. This is typically achieved through:

1.  **Provider-Agnostic Interfaces:** Clear Go interfaces for LLMs, Tools, Memory, VectorStores, Workflow Engines, etc.
2.  **Provider-Specific Implementations:** Concrete structs that implement these interfaces for specific services (e.g., `OpenAI_LLM`, `PgVectorStore`).
3.  **Configuration-Driven Selection:** YAML configuration files allow users to specify which provider to use for each component.
4.  **Factory Patterns:** Factories instantiate the correct provider implementation based on the configuration.

See the [Beluga_Refactored_Architecture.md](./Beluga_Refactored_Architecture.md) for more details on how to extend specific components.

## Key Architectural Features (Post-Refactoring)

The refactored Beluga-ai framework emphasizes a modular and interface-driven design with advanced features for production readiness. Key components are now organized within the `pkg` directory:

*   **`pkg/schema`:** Centralized definitions for all core data structures.
*   **`pkg/core`:** Foundational utilities, dependency injection container, and core model definitions.
*   **`pkg/llms`:** `LLM` interface, provider implementations (e.g., `openai`, `anthropic`), and `LLMProviderFactory`.
*   **`pkg/prompts`:** `PromptAdapter` interface and implementations for model-specific prompt formatting.
*   **`pkg/agents`:** Comprehensive toolkit for agent development (`base`, `tools`, `executor`, `factory`).
    *   `pkg/agents/tools/providers`: Contains implementations for various tool types (e.g., `shell_tool.go`, `gofunction_tool.go`).
*   **`pkg/memory`:** `Memory` interface, basic implementations, and `VectorStoreMemory`.
    *   `pkg/vectorstores`: `VectorStore` interface, provider implementations (e.g., `inmemory`, `pgvector`, `pinecone`), and `VectorStoreProviderFactory`.
    *   `pkg/embeddings`: `Embedder` interface and implementations (e.g., `openai`).
*   **`pkg/orchestration`:** Advanced components for managing complex task sequences.
    *   Enhanced scheduler with worker pools, retry mechanisms, and circuit breakers.
    *   `pkg/orchestration/workflow/factory`: `WorkflowProviderFactory` for different workflow engines.
*   **`pkg/config`:** Advanced configuration management with validation, environment variable support, and defaults.
*   **`pkg/monitoring`:** Comprehensive observability suite including:
    *   Structured logging with context propagation.
    *   Metrics collection and statistical analysis.
    *   Distributed tracing with span support.
    *   Health checking and alerting.

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/lookatitude/beluga-ai
```

## Examples

Detailed usage examples, including how to configure and use different providers for LLMs, VectorStores, and Tools, can be found in the `/examples` directory (to be populated as features are implemented).

## Configuration

Beluga-ai uses Viper for advanced configuration management with validation, environment variable support, and automatic defaults. Configuration can be provided via YAML files, environment variables, or programmatically.

### Configuration Sources (in order of precedence):
1. Environment variables (prefixed with `BELUGA_`)
2. Configuration files (YAML/JSON)
3. Default values

### Example Configuration File (`config.yaml`):

```yaml

### Configuration Validation:
The framework automatically validates configuration on load and provides detailed error messages for missing required fields or invalid values.

## Advanced Features

### Dependency Injection
Beluga-ai includes a comprehensive dependency injection system with functional options patterns:

```go
// Create an agent factory with DI
factory, err := agents.NewAgentFactoryWithOptions(
    agents.WithConfigProvider(configProvider),
    agents.WithContainer(diContainer),
)

// Create agents using fluent builders
agent, err := agents.NewAgentBuilder(factory).
    WithName("data-analyzer").
    WithType("AnalyzerAgent").
    WithAnalysisType("comprehensive").
    Build()
```

### Asynchronous Processing
Advanced orchestration with worker pools, retry mechanisms, and circuit breakers:

```go
// Create enhanced scheduler with worker pool
scheduler := orchestration.NewEnhancedScheduler(10) // 10 workers
scheduler.Start()
defer scheduler.Stop()

// Add tasks with retry configuration
task := &orchestration.EnhancedTask{
    Task: orchestration.Task{
        ID: "data-processing",
        Execute: processData,
    },
    MaxRetries: 3,
    Timeout: 30 * time.Second,
    RequiresCircuitBreaker: true,
}

scheduler.AddEnhancedTask(task)

// Run asynchronously
stats := scheduler.RunAsync()
fmt.Printf("Processed %d tasks\n", stats.CompletedTasks)
```

### Observability & Monitoring
Comprehensive observability suite with structured logging, metrics, and tracing:

```go
// Structured logging with context
logger := monitoring.NewStructuredLogger("my-service",
    monitoring.WithJSONOutput(),
    monitoring.WithFileOutput("logs/app.log"))

ctx, span := tracer.StartSpan(ctx, "process-request")
defer tracer.FinishSpan(span)

logger.Info(ctx, "Processing request", map[string]interface{}{
    "user_id": 12345,
    "request_type": "data_analysis",
})

// Metrics collection
metrics := monitoring.NewMetricsCollector()
timer := metrics.StartTimer(ctx, "request_duration", map[string]string{
    "endpoint": "/api/process",
})
defer timer.Stop(ctx, "Request processing time")

metrics.Counter(ctx, "requests_total", "Total requests", 1, map[string]string{
    "method": "POST",
    "status": "200",
})
```
