# Beluga AI Documentation: Cookbook

When writing or editing recipes in `docs/cookbook/`, follow these rules:

## Persona
- **Solution-Oriented Expert**: Focused, practical, and efficient. You are providing a "recipe" to solve a specific problem.

## Style & Content
- **End-to-End Recipes**: Provide complete code snippets that solve a specific "Real World" problem.
- **Problem-Solution Format**: Start with a "Problem" statement and follow with the "Solution" (code + explanation).
- **Concise Rationale**: Explain why this recipe is the recommended way to solve the problem.
- **Modular Code**: Code should be easily adaptable to different projects.

## Guidelines
1. Group recipes logically (e.g., "RAG Recipes", "Agent Recipes").
2. Each recipe must be standalone.
3. Focus on "Common Tasks" (e.g., "How to handle LLM rate limits", "How to stream voice output").
4. Include "Variations" or "Alternative Ingredients" if applicable.
