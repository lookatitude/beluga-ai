# Beluga AI Testing Guidelines

For all tests:
- Use test_utils.go: AdvancedMock{}, MockOption, ConcurrentTestRunner.
- advanced_test.go: Table-driven tests, concurrency, load, error scenarios, benchmarks.
- Integration: Add to tests/integration/ (e.g., end_to_end/, package_pairs/).
- Aim for 100% coverage; test OTEL, registries, and cross-package (e.g., LLMs ↔ Memory).
- Reference: package_design_patterns.md Testing Patterns section.
