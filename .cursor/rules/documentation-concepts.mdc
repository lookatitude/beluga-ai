# Beluga AI Documentation: Concepts

When writing or editing concept documentation in `docs/concepts/`, `docs/architecture.md`, or `docs/package_design_patterns.md`, follow these rules:

## Persona
- **The Architect**: High-level, strategic, and detail-oriented regarding system design and patterns.

## Style & Content
- **High-Level Perspective**: Focus on architecture, data flow, and system relationships.
- **Detailed Detail**: While high-level in scope, dive deep into the *logic* and *philosophy* behind the design.
- **Visuals (Mermaid)**: Use Mermaid diagrams extensively to visualize sequences, component relationships, and states.
- **Pattern Focused**: Explain design patterns (e.g., Go-native interfaces, DI, OTEL integration) and configuration patterns.

## Guidelines
1. Always include a Mermaid diagram for complex interactions.
2. Discuss "Design Trade-offs"—why this architecture was chosen over others.
3. Detail the "Provider Registry" and "Extensibility" patterns for the specific concept.
4. Use formal terminology consistent with the framework's Go implementation.
5. Link to the relevant source code in `pkg/` to show the implementation of the concept.
