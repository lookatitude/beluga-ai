# Beluga AI Overview & Extensibility

When planning features:
- Core: Extensible via interfaces/factories (e.g., add LLM providers to pkg/llms/providers/).
- Config: Use YAML with validation; env vars prefixed BELUGA_.
- Observability: Structured logging, metrics, tracing via pkg/monitoring.
- Future: Add providers (e.g., Pinecone) using global registries.
- Reference: README.md for installation, examples, and status.
