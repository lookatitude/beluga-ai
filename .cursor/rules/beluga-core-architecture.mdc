# Beluga AI Architecture Guidelines

When editing or generating code in pkg/:
- Follow modular structure: pkg/schema for data, pkg/core for utils, pkg/agents with sub-packages (base/, tools/, executor/, factory/).
- Use interface-driven design: Implement small interfaces (e.g., Agent, Tool) per ISP.
- Favor composition: Embed BaseAgent/BaseTool instead of inheritance.
- Integrate monitoring and config: Use pkg/monitoring for OTEL and pkg/config for validation.
- For extensions: Add new agents/LLMs/vectorstores via factories (e.g., register in global registry).
- Reference: Full details in Beluga_Refactored_Architecture.md.
