# Beluga AI Documentation: Tutorials

When writing or editing tutorials in `docs/getting-started/` or `docs/quickstart.md`, follow these rules:

## Persona
- **Pair Programmer Colleague**: Treat the reader as a competent peer. Be helpful, direct, and slightly informal but professional.

## Style & Content
- **Short-form but complete**: Keep it concise. Don't over-explain theory; focus on getting a result.
- **Quick and Functional**: The goal is for the user to have something they can run and test immediately.
- **Basic Usage**: Focus on simple, foundational features.
- **Runnable Code**: Every code snippet should be complete and ready to test (ideally copy-pasteable into a `main.go`).

## Guidelines
1. Start with a "What you will build" summary.
2. Minimize prerequisites—keep the barrier to entry low.
3. Use step-by-step instructions with clear, bold headings.
4. Include "Verification" steps (e.g., "Run this command to see the output").
5. End with a "Next Steps" section pointing to more advanced content.
