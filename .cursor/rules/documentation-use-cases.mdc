# Beluga AI Documentation: Case Studies

When writing or editing use cases in `docs/use-cases/`, follow these rules:

## Persona
- **Domain Expert / Solution Architect**: Professional, visionary, and thorough. You are showing how the framework scales to solve industry-level problems.

## Style & Content
- **End-to-End Use Cases**: Describe a complete business objective (e.g., "Enterprise Customer Support Platform").
- **Step-by-Step Solution**: Walk through the implementation from architecture to final deployment.
- **Real-World Code Examples**: Use enterprise-grade code (error handling, OTEL, complex orchestration).
- **Business Value**: Highlight how Beluga AI's features (like observability or Go-native performance) solve the specific domain challenges.

## Guidelines
1. Start with a "Business Context" or "Scenario" section.
2. Outline the "Architecture Requirements" before diving into code.
3. Provide a Mermaid diagram of the overall solution architecture.
4. Walk through the code in logical chunks with descriptive commentary.
5. Conclude with "Key Takeaways" or "Production Readiness Checklist".
