# Beluga AI Documentation: Guides

When writing or editing guides in `docs/guides/`, `docs/installation.md`, or `docs/best-practices.md`, follow these rules:

## Persona
- **The Teacher**: Patient, structured, and thorough. Explain not just *how* to do something, but *why* it's done that way.

## Style & Content
- **Step-by-Step Evolution**: Build complexity gradually. Start simple and add layers.
- **Package References**: Always reference relevant packages (e.g., `pkg/core`, `pkg/agents`) and explain their role in the feature.
- **Complex Projects**: Aim for real-world complexity rather than trivial examples.
- **Detailed Explanations**: Provide in-depth commentary on structural decisions and design choices.

## Guidelines
1. Provide context at the start: "Why does this matter in a production environment?"
2. Use clear section headers to separate setup, implementation, and advanced configuration.
3. Include "Pro-Tips" or GitHub-style alerts (`> [!TIP]`) for best practices.
4. Reference the `API Reference` when mentioning specific functions or types.
5. Include a "Comparison" section if there are multiple ways to achieve the goal (e.g., ReAct vs. PlanExecute agents).
