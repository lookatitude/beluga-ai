# Beluga AI Framework Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
ALL packages MUST define small, focused interfaces that serve specific purposes. NO "god interfaces" that force implementations to depend on unused methods. Use "er" suffix for single-method interfaces (Embedder, Retriever), noun-based names for multi-method interfaces (VectorStore, Agent). Every interface MUST have clear documentation explaining its purpose and usage.

**Rationale**: Focused interfaces enable easier testing, cleaner implementations, and better composition of functionality across the AI framework.

### II. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) 
High-level modules MUST NOT depend on low-level modules. Both MUST depend on abstractions (interfaces). ALL dependencies MUST be injected via constructors. Use functional options pattern for flexible configuration. NO global state or singleton patterns except for global registries.

**Rationale**: Dependency injection enables testing with mocks, supports multiple provider implementations, and makes the framework extensible without modification.

### III. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Each package MUST have one primary responsibility. Each struct/function MUST have one reason to change. Packages MUST be focused and cohesive around a single AI/ML domain (embeddings, memory, agents, etc.). NO mixing of concerns across package boundaries.

**Rationale**: Single responsibility ensures maintainable code, clear boundaries, and enables teams to work independently on different AI components.

### IV. Composition over Inheritance with Functional Options
MUST prefer embedding interfaces/structs over type hierarchies. ALL configuration MUST use functional options pattern. NO complex inheritance structures. Enable flexible composition of AI behaviors through interface composition and functional options.

**Rationale**: Composition provides flexibility for AI workflows where different combinations of capabilities are needed for different use cases.

## Implementation Standards

### Package Structure (MANDATORY COMPLIANCE)
ALL packages MUST follow this exact structure with NO deviations:

```
pkg/{package_name}/
├── iface/                    # Interfaces and types (REQUIRED)
├── internal/                 # Private implementation details
├── providers/               # Provider implementations (for multi-provider packages)
├── config.go                # Configuration structs and validation (REQUIRED)
├── metrics.go               # OTEL metrics implementation (REQUIRED)
├── errors.go                # Custom error types with Op/Err/Code pattern (REQUIRED)
├── {package_name}.go        # Main interfaces and factory functions
├── factory.go OR registry.go # Global factory/registry for multi-provider packages
├── test_utils.go            # Advanced testing utilities and mocks (REQUIRED)
├── advanced_test.go         # Comprehensive test suites (REQUIRED)
└── README.md                # Package documentation (REQUIRED)
```

**Status**: 100% compliance achieved across all 14 packages. NO exceptions permitted.

### Global Registry Pattern (MULTI-PROVIDER PACKAGES)
ALL multi-provider packages MUST implement the global registry pattern for consistent provider management:

```go
type ProviderRegistry struct {
    mu       sync.RWMutex
    creators map[string]func(ctx context.Context, config Config) (Interface, error)
}

var globalRegistry = NewProviderRegistry()
func RegisterGlobal(name string, creator func(...) (Interface, error))
func NewProvider(ctx context.Context, name string, config Config) (Interface, error)
```

**Mandatory for**: embeddings, memory, agents, vectorstores, llms, chatmodels, retrievers, prompts, orchestration, monitoring, config, server.

### OpenTelemetry Integration (MANDATORY)
ALL packages MUST implement standardized OTEL metrics, tracing, and logging. NO custom metrics implementations. ALL packages MUST include metrics.go with:

```go
func NewMetrics(meter metric.Meter, tracer trace.Tracer) (*Metrics, error)
func (m *Metrics) RecordOperation(ctx context.Context, operation string, duration time.Duration, success bool)
func NoOpMetrics() *Metrics
```

**Status**: 100% OTEL standardization complete across all packages.

### Error Handling (ENFORCED STANDARD)
ALL packages MUST implement structured error handling with Op/Err/Code pattern:

```go
type {Package}Error struct {
    Op   string // operation that failed
    Err  error  // underlying error  
    Code string // error code for programmatic handling
}
```

Standard error codes MUST be defined as constants. ALL errors MUST preserve error chains through Unwrap().

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### Testing Requirements (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
ALL packages MUST implement enterprise-grade testing with 100% compliance:

1. **test_utils.go (REQUIRED)**: Advanced mocking utilities with `AdvancedMock{Package}`, `Mock{Package}Option`, `ConcurrentTestRunner`, performance testing helpers
2. **advanced_test.go (REQUIRED)**: Table-driven tests, concurrency testing, error handling scenarios, performance benchmarks
3. **Integration testing**: Cross-package testing in `tests/integration/` directory
4. **100% test coverage**: ALL public methods MUST have comprehensive test coverage
5. **Performance benchmarks**: ALL critical operations MUST have benchmark tests
6. **Concurrency validation**: ALL packages MUST test thread safety

### Quality Gates (ENFORCED)
- NO code may be merged without passing ALL tests
- NO performance regressions permitted without explicit approval
- ALL new providers MUST pass standardized interface compliance tests
- ALL cross-package interactions MUST have integration tests

**Status**: Complete testing infrastructure implemented across all packages.

## Implementation Standards

### Post-Implementation Workflow (MANDATORY)
ALL feature implementations MUST follow the standardized post-implementation workflow to ensure consistent integration:

1. **Comprehensive Commit Message**: Create detailed commit message documenting constitutional compliance, performance achievements, and key enhancements
2. **Branch Push**: Push feature branch to origin with all changes committed  
3. **Pull Request Creation**: Create PR from feature branch to `develop` branch with implementation summary
4. **Merge to Develop**: Merge PR to develop branch after all tests pass
5. **Post-Merge Validation**: Verify functionality and run comprehensive tests post-merge

This workflow ensures systematic integration through the develop branch and maintains constitutional compliance across all feature implementations.

**Rationale**: Consistent workflow enables quality gates, proper documentation, and systematic integration of constitutional compliance features.

## Governance

### Amendment Procedure
Constitution amendments require:
1. **Documentation**: Detailed rationale for changes in GitHub issue/PR
2. **Impact Assessment**: Analysis of affected packages and breaking changes
3. **Migration Plan**: Clear upgrade path for existing implementations
4. **Review**: Approval from framework maintainers
5. **Implementation**: Updates to all affected template files and documentation

### Compliance Review
- ALL pull requests MUST verify constitutional compliance
- Quarterly audits of package compliance with principles
- Automated linting rules MUST enforce structural compliance
- Constitutional violations MUST be documented and justified

### Versioning Policy
- **MAJOR**: Backward incompatible principle changes or removals
- **MINOR**: New principles added or material expansions
- **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording improvements, typo fixes

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-01-05 | **Last Amended**: 2025-01-05
